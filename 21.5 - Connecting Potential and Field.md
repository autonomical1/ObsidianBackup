**Connecting Potential and Field**:
- Electric field at a point is perpendicular to the equipotential surface at that point.
- The electric field at a point is perpendicular to the equipotential surface at that point
- The electric field points in the direction of decreasing potential.
- any two points inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium are at the same potential.
