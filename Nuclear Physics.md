- Nuclear structure:
	- Atomic nuclei consist of protons and neutrons (nucleons)
	- Proton: charge = $+e$, mass = $1.00728 u$  
	- Neutron: charge = $0$, mass = $1.00866 u$ 
	- Notation for elements: $_{A}^{Z}<element>$ 
		- $_{6}^{12}C$ , $^{238}_{92}U$, $^{4}_{2}He$
		- Neutron number: N = A - Z
- Isotopes: Atoms of the same element($Z$), but different neutron number ($N$)
	- e.g.: $^{12}_{6}C$, $^{13}_{6}C$
- Nuclear Stability: 
	- Light nuclei with $N \approx Z$ are most stable.
	- Why?
		- As the nucleus gets bigger, the strong force exerts the same relative amount of force, but the coulombic repulsion increases
		- Nuclear Potential Energy
	- Heavy nuclei are stable when $N \gt Z$
	- Neutrons contribute nuclear "glue" without coulombic repulsion
	- Coulombic potential energy
- Binding Energy:
	- Mass-Energy Equivalence: $E_{0} = m_{0}c^{2}$
		- $\Delta m = \Delta E_{0}$
			- $E_{0}$ is the binding energy for nucleons
	- Nuclear binding energy is computed by considering the mass difference between the atom and its separate components, Z hydrogen atoms and N neutrons: $$B = (Zm_{H} + Nm_{n} - m_{atom}) * (931.49 \text {MeV/u})$$

- Low-Z Nuclei
	- Proton and neutron potential energy are almost equal when $Z$ is small
	- Nuclear energy-level diagram of $^{12}C$, which has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, showing it is in its lowest possible energy state
	- $^{12}B$ and $^{12}N$ could lower their energies in a process called *beta decay* - where a proton turns into a neutron or vice versa.
