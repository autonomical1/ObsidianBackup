- over the last 40 years, income inequality has been increasing

# Who's Getting What?
- **income distribution**: the way that income is divided into shares ranging from the poor to the rich
	- distribution of income among groups is very uneven
- **relative deprivation**: perception that he/she is not doing as well as others economically
	- results from increasing income inequality
- **income**: amount of money collected b/w 2 points in time
- **wealth**: value of assets owned

# Who's Poor in America?
- **poverty line**: income threshold before a person is considered poor
	- based on what a family must spend for a necessary standard of living, 3x price of a subsistence diet
- income of 3x subsistence diet is enough for a family's living costs
- however, this is an underestimation of the number of impoverished people in the US
- over half of Americans will be under the poverty line at age 25-75 for a year
	- **feminization of poverty**: women that are poor are the majority of poor
		- unmarried women with children

# How Public Policy Affects Income
- some people believe that the government should help poor people

#### Taxation
- **progressive tax**: tax where government takes a larger share of income from the rich than the poor
- **proportional tax**: tax where the government takes the same amount of money from everyone, no matter their position in income
- **regressive tax**: tax where government takes more money from the poor than the rich
- sales taxes are considered a "partially regressive" tax because it takes more money from the poor when they spend more money on necessities
- federal income taxes are progressive
- **Earned Income Tax Credit**: refundable federal income tax credit for low to moderate income families, even if they did not earn enough money to file a tax return

#### Government Expenditures
- millions of government checks are mailed to people dependent on government programs
