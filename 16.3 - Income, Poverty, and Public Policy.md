- over the last 40 years, income inequality has been increasing

# Who's Getting What?
- **income distribution**: the way that income is divided into shares ranging from the poor to the rich
	- distribution of income among groups is very uneven
- **relative deprivation**: perception that he/she is not doing as well as others economically
	- results from increasing income inequality
- **income**: amount of money collected b/w 2 points in time
- **wealth**: value of assets owned

# Who's Poor in America?
- **poverty line**: income threshold before a person is considered poor
	- based on what a family must spend for a necessary standard of living, 3x price of a subsistence diet
- income of 3x subsistence diet is enough for a family's living costs
- however, this is an underestimation of the number of impoverished people in the US
