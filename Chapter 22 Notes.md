**Parallel-plate capacitor:** 
- $\Delta U_{E} = W_{ext} = F_{ext} \cdot x$
- $\Delta U_{E} = qEx$, where E is uniform
	- $\Delta U_{E}$ depends on q
- $\Delta U_{E} = q\Delta V$ 
- Find a quantity that depends only on $\overrightarrow{E}$
	- Define electric potential as $\Delta V = \frac{{\Delta U_{E}}}{{q}}$
		- SI Unit: Volt (V)
			- $1V = 1 \frac{J}{C}$
		- $\Delta U_{E} = qEx$, Then $\Delta V$ = $\frac{{\Delta U_{E}}}{{q}}$, q cancels, so $\Delta V = E \cdot x$
		- Let d be the plate separation. Then, $\Delta V_{c} = E \cdot d$
- Electric potential of a parallel-plate capacitor at a position x, measured from the negative plate is:
	- $V = \frac{U_{elec}}{q} = Ex = \frac{Q}{Îµ_{0} \cdot a}x$ 
	- Increases linearly from negative plat to positive plate at x=d
	- Potential difference $\Delta V_{c}$ between the two capacitor plates
		- $\Delta V_{c} = V_{+} - V_{-} = Ed$ 
		- $E = \frac{\Delta V_{c}}{d}$

**Connecting Potential and Field**:
- Electric field at a point is perpendicular to the equipotential surface at that point.

**Charging a Capacitor**: 
- 2 uncharged plates, no charge, no potential difference
	- no charge = no *net* charge
	- to charge, take a positive charge from one plate and move it to the other plate
	- No Q, $\Delta V$, $\Delta U$, or $W_{ext}$
	- Total work: $W_{ext}= \sum{i} \Delta W$ 
	- Results in: 
		- $\Delta U_{c} = \frac{Q^{2}}{2C}= \frac{1}{2}C\Delta V^{2} = \frac{1}{2} Q\Delta V$

**Electric Current**: 
- Consists of charges flowing through some region of space
- Analogous to water flowing through a pipe

**Definition of Current (I)**:
- $I = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$
- SI unit: Ampere (amp)
	- 1 Amp = $\frac{1C}{1S}$
- Conductor: some charge may freely flow.
	- Metals -> outer most electrons are loosely bound.
		- "Conduction electrons"
- **Conventional Current**: Flows in the direction of positive charges

**Conservation of Current at a Junction**:
- **junction**: point where wire branches
- total charge in must be total charge out
- $\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out}$
- **Kirchhoff's Junction Law**: the sum of the currents into the junction equals the sum of the currents leaving

**Batteries and emf**
- Capacitor quickly runs out of excess charge, but a wire connecting the battery terminals can keep the charges in motion
