**Parallel-plate capacitor:** 
- $\Delta U_{E} = W_{ext} = F_{ext} \cdot x$
- $\Delta U_{E} = qEx$, where E is uniform
	- $\Delta U_{E}$ depends on q
- $\Delta U_{E} = q\Delta V$ 
- Find a quantity that depends only on $\overrightarrow{E}$
	- Define electric potential as $\Delta V = \frac{{\Delta U_{E}}}{{q}}$
		- SI Unit: Volt (V)
			- $1V = 1 \frac{J}{C}$
		- $\Delta U_{E} = qEx$, Then $\Delta V$ = $\frac{{\Delta U_{E}}}{{q}}$, q cancels, so $\Delta V = E \cdot x$
		- Let d be the plate separation. Then, $\Delta V_{c} = E \cdot d$
- Electric potential of a parallel-plate capacitor at a position x, measured from the negative plate is:
	- $V = \frac{U_{elec}}{q} = Ex = \frac{Q}{Îµ_{0} \cdot a}x$ 
	- Increases linearly from negative plat to positive plate at x=d
	- Potential difference $\Delta V_{c}$ between the two capacitor plates
		- $\Delta V_{c} = V_{+} - V_{-} = Ed$ 
		- $E = \frac{\Delta V_{c}}{d}$

**Connecting Potential and Field**:
- Electric field at a point is perpendicular to the equipotential surface at that point.

**Charging a Capacitor**: 
- 2 uncharged plates, no charge, no potential difference
	- no charge = no *net* charge
	- to charge, take a positive charge from one plate and move it to the other plate
	- No Q, $\Delta V$, $\Delta U$, or $W_{ext}$
	- Total work: $W_{ext}= \sum{i} \Delta W$ 
	- Results in: 
		- $\Delta U_{c} = \frac{Q^{2}}{2C}= \frac{1}{2}C\Delta V^{2} = \frac{1}{2} Q\Delta V$

**Electric Current**: 
- Consists of charges flowing through some region of space
- Analogous to water flowing through a pipe

**Definition of Current (I)**:
- $I = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$
- SI unit: Ampere (amp)
	- 1 Amp = $\frac{1C}{1S}$
- Conductor: some charge may freely flow.
	- Metals -> outer most electrons are loosely bound.
		- "Conduction electrons"
- **Conventional Current**: Flows in the direction of positive charges

**Conservation of Current at a Junction**:
- **junction**: point where wire branches
- total charge in must be total charge out
- $\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out}$
- **Kirchhoff's Junction Law**: the sum of the currents into the junction equals the sum of the currents leaving

**Batteries and emf**
- Capacitor quickly runs out of excess charge, but a wire connecting the battery terminals can keep the charges in motion
- The inner workings of a battery act like a charge escalator between the 2 terminals
- charges are removed from the negative terminal and "lifted" into the positive terminal
- Chemicals called *electrolytes* sandwiched between 2 electrodes of different material. chemicals react and move + ions from one electrode to another. 
- By separating charge, charge escalator est. $\Delta V$ between the terminals of a battery
- potential difference established by a device like a battery = emf
- emf also written as $\epsilon$
- rating of a battery, like 1.5 V = battery's emf
	- determined by the chemicals in the battery
	- battery with no current in it has a $\Delta V$ equal to its emf
- **Electric Circuit**: 
- 3 basic requirements
	- 1. Source of potential difference (Battery/Power Supply)
	- 2. Closed conducting path (circuit)
	- 3. Circuit element/load/load resistance

**Connecting Potential and Current**:
- A battery is a source of potential difference
- current that flows through a wire connecting the battery terminals is a consequence of the potential difference
- because the ends of the wire are connected to the terminals of the battery, $\Delta V$ = $\Delta V$ between the battery terminals. 
	- $\Delta V_{wire} = \Delta V_{bat}$
- potential difference causes a current

**Resistance**:
- Current in a circuit: $I \propto \Delta V$
- Adding a second battery increases potential difference increases electric field, and therefore the current
- Increasing the length of the wire connecting the battery decreases the current, while increasing the thickness of the wire increases the current
- wires of different material will carry different currents. some materials are better conductors than others
- **Resistance**: measure of how hard it is to push charges through a wire. A large resistance implies that it is hard to move charges through the wire. The current depends on the resistance of the wire and the potential difference between the ends of the wire.

**Ohm's Law and Resistor Circuits**:
- $R = \frac{\Delta V_{wire}}{I}$
- Si Unit = 1 Ohm = 1 $\Omega$ = 1 $\frac{V}{A}$  
- Ohm's Law: $\Delta V = I \cdot R$ 
- Not a law of nature, not all conductors follow Ohm's Law
- Materials that follow Ohm's Law = **ohmic**
- If the graph of I vs V is linear, the material is non-ohmic, and if it is non-linear it would be non-ohmic

**Resistors**:
- Circuit elements that are designed to have certain resistance for practical reasons
- Uses:
	- Current Limiter
	- Voltage divider
- 
**Resistivity**:
- $\rho$ characterizes the electrical properties of materials
- Materials that are good conductors have low resistivity
- Materials that are poor conductors (good insulators) = high resistivity
- resistivity of a metal decreases with increasing temperature
- $R = \frac{\rho \cdot L}{A}$ 
	- property of a specific wire, since it depends on the conductors length, diameter and material

 **Energy and Power**:
 - The charge escalator transfers the chemical energy $E_{chem}$ to the electric potential energy U of the charges
 - That energy is then dissipated as the charges move through the lightbulb, keeping the filament warm and glowing
 - The battery provides potential energy to a charge "q" as it lifts the charge up the charge escalator from the negative to the positive terminal
 - The rate at which energy is transferred from the battery to the moving charges is:
	 - $P_{bat} =$ rate of energy transfer $= \frac{\Delta U}{\Delta t} = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}\epsilon$
	 - $P_{emf} = I \epsilon$ 
	 - Units: $1 \frac{J}{s}$ or W

**Kirchhoff's Loop Rule**:
- Any closed loop in a circuit has $\Delta V = 0$

**Series and Parallel Circuits**:
- **Series circuit**: if circuit elements are connected directly to each other with no junction in between
- **Parallel circuit**: if circuit elements are not connected directly to each other and have a junction in between
	- Current will divide due to Kirchhoff's Junction Rule

**Series Resistors**:
- When there are two resistors in series, the current must be the same in both resistors because there are no junctions in the circuit
- Kirchhoff's Loop Rule shows potential differences:
	- $$\sum\limits \Delta V_{i} = \epsilon + \Delta V_{1} + \Delta V_{2} = 0$$
- An easy way to model multiple resistors in series is creating an equivalent resistor:
	- $$R_{eq} = R_{1} + R_{2} + . . . + R_{n}$$
	-
