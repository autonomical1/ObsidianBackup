- **Allusion**: direct/indirect reference to something which is presumably commonly known

- **Anaphora**: repetition of words at the beginning of successive clause

- **Antanaclasis**: a rhetorical device in which a phrase or word is repeatedly used, but in a different, often contrary, sense
	- a play on words

			- speaker is addressing the stars, the clouds, and the winds
- **Asyndeton**: Figure of speech in which normally occurring *conjunctions* are intentionally omitted

		- pen => written word
		- sword => military aggression
- **Synecdoche**: where a word standing for a part of something is used for the whole of that thing or vice versa
	- can give otherwise common ideas or objects deeper meanings
	- helps writers achieve brevity
	- adds a distinct color to words making them appear vivid
	- Example:
		- "The western wave as all a-flame"
			- "western wave" refers to the sea as one of its parts (wave)
	- ***Difference between Synecdoche and Metonymy**
		- metonymy - something connected to the idea being referenced
		- synecdoche - type of metonymy but more specific
			- refers specifically to when an actual part of something is used to represent the whole or vice versa.
- **Parallelism**: (a.k.a. parallel construction/structure) refers to the grammatical or rhetorical framing of words, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs to give *structural similarity*
