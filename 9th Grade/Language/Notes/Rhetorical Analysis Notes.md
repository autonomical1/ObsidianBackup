- Decide on an organizational structure
	- no one size fits all structure for essay
	- may devote a paragraph for each rhetorical appeal, but make sure that there are concise and specific topic sentences
	- examine thesis - does it break down neatly into topics that are usable for basis of paragraphs?
- Tone ; **formal and academic**
	- avoid colloquialisms
	- seek clarity first, style second
	- if not sure if word is used correctly, find another word
- Using short quotations can provide clarity
	- when using textual evidence, a direct quote will allow you to focus more precisely on what the author is saying
		- remove unnecessary words from quotes with an ellipsis (make sure sentence still makes grammatical sense)
- Topic sentence should be forecasted in thesis, and should cover every aspect of the thesis
	- Don't surprise reader by introducing a new argument midway through your essay, because introduction should tell reader what to expect. 
	- Don't leave any element of thesis undiscussed - by end of essay, the entire thesis should be supported
- Topic senteces should make argumentative claims
	- If your thesis is merely a fact, it needs to be revised
	- should provide a defensible piece of evidence that supports thesis
- Paragraphs should be more than half analysis - not summary
	- provide as much summary as necessary to help reader understand textual evidence
	- summary is rephrasing text
	- analysis: evaluates, makes inferences, forms connections between ideas
- Explain each step of argument in great detail
	- reader does not know what's in the writers head - spell out the argument clearly and fully
	- when you explain how your evidence supports the assertion in your topic sentence, or how your paragraph supports your thesis, err on the side of explaining too much rather than too little
- Don't end body paragraphs with textual evidence
	- Follow a Point me to the SEA structure
		- Topic Sentence (point)
		- Support
		- Explain
		- Analyze
- Use as much evidence as is necessary to make point
	- One example per paragraph may not be enough - 8 is too much
	- Ask, how many strong pieces of evidence are needed to support my claim
	- How much evidence do I need to give my readers in order to convince them of my claim?
- Avoid "dropped" quotes
	- avoid context-less quotes because they can disorient the reader and make it abrupt
	- Introduce your textual evidence with a signal phrase.
		- Ex: _Lawson writes, "..."
- Quote only as much as you intend to analyze
	- adding long quotes can make essay longer, but it doesn't make it better
	- reader may lose track ot the point you are trying to make
	- if whole quote is necessary to argument, consider breaking it into pieces and providing analysis after each piece
- Avoid value judgements
	- make judgments about author's rhetorical choices, but you should refraim from judging the author's character or morality
	- adopt a neutral tone
	- avoid saying author "brilliantly" or "wonderfully" does something
- Avoid the use of first person
	- "I believe that..."
- Don't make indefensible claims of broad statements
	- all, never, everyone
