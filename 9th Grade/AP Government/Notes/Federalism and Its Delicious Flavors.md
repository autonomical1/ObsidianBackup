- **Federalism**: constitutional arrangement in which power is distributed between a central government and subdivisional governments (states) 
	- power shared between state and federal governments
	- Constitution designates certain powers to be federal and some to states
	- exists opposed to *unitary system*: powers rest solely in national government
- Reasons for Federalism
	- Customizability and Responsiveness
		- Brutus I: Federal government can't respond to the needs of the people
		- allows state governments to respond quicker to local needs
	- Laboratory Effect:
		- states can try laws to see if they work before adopting on a national level
	- Prevents Tyranny
		- this is due to the separation of powers
