- presidents try to impose their policy standards on agencies.

## <p style="text-align:center;">Tactics</p>
### Appoint the right people to head the agency
-  putting their own ppl into government positions is a good way to influence policy

###  Issue Orders 
- can issue **executive orders** (regulations originating with the executive branch) used to implement statues, treaties, etc. rhetoric in speeches also can influence the bureaucracy

### Alter an agency's budget
- the OMB is the own authority on any agency's budget. Cuts to the budget can bring the President to the agencies attention

### Reorganize an agency
- President Reagan tried to abolish Energy and Education, but couldn't succeed because they were backed by elements in Congress and strong constituent groups

# Congress tries to control the Bureaucracy
- Congress has a paradoxical relationship with the Bureaucracy
	- some mbrs of Congress find a big bureaucracy congenial
	- big bureaucracies prov. services to constituents, who may show appreciation in polls
- when congress lacks answers to policy problems, they hope bureaucracy finds the solution
- Congress is usually the problem identifying part of government, and bureaucracies solve those problems

### Influence appt. of agency heads
- members of congress can put their opinions on agency heads even though they aren't required to give confirmation to the president
- when congressional apprv. is required, it is doubly influential

### Alter an agency's budget
- power of the purse is a big influence on agencies
- changing budget can tell agency what to do

### Hold hearings
- can hold periodic hearings as part of the oversight
- may parade flagrant agency abuses of congressional intent in front of the press

### Rewrite the legislation or make it more detailed
- congress can overturn agency rules/limit an agency's auth to make them

# Iron Triangles and Issue Networks
- agencies' strong ties to interest groups and to congressional (sub)committees complicate efforts to control bureaucracy
- **Iron Triangles**: a.k.a. subgovernments; when agencies, groups and committees all depend on each other and are in close contact 
	- have advantages for all sides
	- add a strong decentralizing and fragmenting element to the policymaking process
- Recently, subgovernments have also had "issue networks"
	- led to more widespread participation in bureaucratic policymaking
### The death of the Iron Triangle
- Although subgovernments are often able to dominate policymaking for decades, they are not indestructible
- Congress established a special joint committee, the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, with complete control over questions of nuclear power. It also created a new executive agency, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Th e committee, the commission, the private companies that built nuclear power plants, and the electrical utilities that operated them together formed a powerful subgovernment. America built more nuclear power plants than any other country in the world, and American technology was exported overseas to dozens of nations
- The extraordinarily high price of gasoline and heating fuel since 2005 and concerns over global warming have encouraged a reconsideration of nuclear power.
