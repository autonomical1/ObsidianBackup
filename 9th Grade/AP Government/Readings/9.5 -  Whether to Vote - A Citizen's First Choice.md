- **suffrage**: right to vote
	- exceptions are noncitizens and prisoners
	- no federal req. for voters to be citizens, but no states currently permit noncitizens to vote
		- some immigrant IGs want it to be changed at the local level
	- virtually all states deny prisoners the right to vote, some deny during parole, and 10 deny for the lifetime
	- as the right to vote has been extended, less people have voted
		- turnouts were at its peak in the 1896 elections
# Deciding Whether to Vote
- one vote deciding an election is very unlikely
- it is difficult for people to make the occasion, which causes the low voter turnouts
	- some people believe that Election Day should be moved to a Saturday or become a holiday
- people who see policy diffs. b/w parties are more likely to vote
- people may also vote because they have a high **political efficacy** (belief that one's political participation matters)
- people with low political efficacy tend to have a lesser incentive to vote
	- still may vote because of **civil duty**: belief in order to preserve democratic government, a citizen should vote
# Registering to vote
- **voter registration laws**: system adopted by states that requires voters to register before voting
	- have made it more difficult for votes to be counted more than once, but have also discouraged people from voting at all
	- some states do not require registration, and some let voters register on Election Day.
	- Changed by **1993 Motor Voter Act**: made reg. easier by requiring states to allow eligible voters to apply by simply checking a box on their DL app.
- process for voting has become harder even though it is intended to be easier
