- Courts provide an arena for 2 parties to bring their conflict before an impartial arbiter (judge)
	- task is to apply the law to the case, determining which party is legally correct
- System is based on theory that justice will emerge out of the struggle between 2 contending POVs
- 2 types of cases:
	- *Criminal Law Case*: Gov't charges an individual w/ violating specific laws
	- *Civil Law Case*: Dispute between 2 parties

# Participants in the Judicial System
- Judges are the policy makers of the American judicial system

### Litigants
- Constitution restricts federal judges to deciding against actual disputes against hypothetical ones
- Judiciary is passive, dependent on others to take the initiative
- every case is between a plaintiff and defendant
	- *Plaintiff*: bringer of charge
	- *Defendant*: person accused of charge
- *jury*: group of citizens (around 12) responsible for determining the outcome of a lawsuit
- Plaintiffs must have **Standing to sue**: have serious interest in a case which is typically determined by whether they are in danger or could be in danger
- **Class Action Suit**: permit a small number of people to sue on behalf of all who are affected by a common problem created by an individual/corporation
- **Justiciable Dispute**: issues capable of being settled by legal methods

### Attorneys
- Lawyers are necessary in a judicial system
- federally funded Legal Services Corporation provides lawyers to serve the legal needs of the poor, and state/local gov'ts provide public defenders for poor people accused of crimes
	-	Provides the quality of representation is equal
- However, the poor are often served with overworked attorneys w/ few resources to devote to an individual case

### Groups
- interest groups seek out litigants whose cases seem particularly strong
- **amicus curiae ("friend of the court") briefs**: legal briefs submitted by an interested person for the purpose of influencing a court's decision by raising more POVs and presenting info not contained in the briefs of the formal parties
