- **political socialization**: process through which an individual acquires his or her particular political orientations
	- as age increases, orientations grow firmer
	- governments aim socialization efforts largely at the young

# The Process of Political Socialization
- only a small portion of American political learning is formal
- informal learning of government is more important than formal learning because most of it is acquired by environment

#### The Family
- role in socialization is central because of the access it has to time and emotional commitment
- parents interest in politics => child's interest in politics
- children pick up their political orientations as a child
- genetics play an important role in shaping political attitudes

#### The Mass Media
- TV displaces parents as the main source of information as children get older
- TV still is used more by the older population than the younger

#### School
- governments use schools to promote national loyalty and support for its basic values
- any democracy has a vested interest in students learning positive features of their political system.
- Schooling is one of the most obvious intrusions of the government into American socialization

# Political Learning over a Lifetime
- does not end once one reaches 18 or graduates college, it is a lifetime thing
- aging increases political participation as well as strength of party attachment
- strength of party ident. increases as people develop a pattern of voting for one party or another
