- **Electoral College**: unique American institution, created by the Constitution, which selects president using electors selected by the state parties. Usually reflects a popular majority, but populated states can be overrepresented and winner-take-all rule concentrates campaigns
	- System:
		- each state has as many electoral votes as senators + representatives
			- state parties select electors, used as a reward for faithful service to the party
		- 48/50 states use winner-take-all system where all electors are awarded to presidential candidate with a simple majority (51%)
		- in ME and NE, elector is allocated for every district won, and whoever wins states wins both electors given to state based on senators
		- electors meet in December, following Nov. election, and then mail votes to VP
			- counted when the new Congressional session opens in Jan, reported by VP
		- If no candidate wins EC, vote is given to House of Reps. which choose among top 3 electoral vote winners.
			- each state has 1 vote, small state and big state have same voting power
		- EC important to election for 2 reasons:
			- introduces a bias into campaign and electoral process
			- winner-take-all allows candidates to focus on **battleground states**: The key states that the presidential campaigns focus on because they are most likely to decide the outcome of the Electoral College vote.
