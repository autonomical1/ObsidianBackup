- Oscillation is a kind of motion in which an object moves back and forth around an equilibrium position
# 12-2
- Oscillation is caused by the interplay between 1) a restoring force that returns an object to its equilibrium position (where it experiences 0 net force) and 2) inertia that makes the object overshoot equilibrium
- The period of an oscillation is the time for one complete cycle. The frequency, which is the reciprocal of the period, is the number of cycles per second
- The amplitude of an oscillation equals the magnitude of the maximum displacement from equilibrium
# 12-3
- Elastic materials return to their original shape and size when the stress has been removed, while plastic materials exhibit a permanent change in shape.
# 12-4
- The amplitude of an oscillation is the maximum positive displacement from equilibrium.
- The object oscillating under the influence of a Hooke's law restoring force is called simple harmonic motion (SHM). The angular frequency, period, and frequency and SHM are unaffected by changes in the oscillation amplitude.
- SHM is identical to the projection onto the X axis of the motion in uniform circular motion.
- Graphs of the position, velocity, and acceleration in SHM are sinusoidal curves. In each of these graphs, the phase angle shifts the location of the vertical axis to the right or left.

- Energy is transformed back and forth from kinetic energy to potential energy in systems that contain mechanical or biological springs.
- When an object attached to a spring is at maximum displacement, the energy of the object-spring system is entirely potential energy.
- When the object passes through equilibrium, the energy of the object spring system is entirely kinetic energy.
- The total energy of an object, spring system, the maximum potential energy, and the maximum kinetic energy, or are all equal to 1/2kA<sup>2</sup>
# 12-6
- In a simple pendulum, the mass of the pendulum is concentrated at a fixed distance from a rotation point.
- The angular frequency, the period, and the frequency of a simple pendulum depend on the length of the pendulum and the acceleration due to gravity. They do not depend on the pendulum mass or the amplitude of the motion, as long as the amplitude is small.
# 12-7
- A physical pendulum has its mass distributed throughout its volume. Unlike a simple pendulum, it cannot be treated as an object suspended at the end of a string of negligible mass.
- The gravitational torque that arises when the pendulum is displaced from equilibrium provides the restoring torque that caused the pendulum to return to its equilibrium position.
- The angular frequency, period, and frequency of a physical pendulum depend on the way its mass is distributed, the distance around the pivot point to the pendulum's center of mass, and the pendulum's rotational inertia around that point. Just as for a simple pendulum, these quantities do not depend on the amplitude of motion, for small amplitudes.
