- **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: rotational analog of conservation of linear momentum
	- Similar to the principle of conservation of linear momentum where an object or system can set another object into rotational motion
	- angular momentum is always conserved
- An object's linear momentum is (m)(v), whereas a rotating object's angular momentum depends on its rotation axis (for a rotating extended object, it also depends on its shape)

# 11-2
- **Angular Momentum**: the product of the moment of inertia of the rotating object and the angular velocity along the rotation axis
	- L<sub>z</sub> = Iω<sub>z</sub>
	- L is directly proportional to both moment of inertia and angular velocity
	- If there is no Στ on a system, the L of the system is constant
## Angular Momentum of an Object
- Objects with linear momentum can also have angular momentum where angular momentum is the radius of the object multiplied by the linear momentum of the object
	- L = rp = rp sin Θ = r(mv) sin Θ
		- p = linear momentum
		- r = radius
	- L = rp sin Θ = rmv sin Θ = rmv<sub>perp</sub> = rm(rω) = mr<sup>2</sup>ω = Iω
- an object moving past a point in space with a perpendicular distance b/w the velocity and the point has L relative to the point, even if it isn't following a curved path

# 11-3
- The angular velocity and angular momentum of a rotating extended object, or an object moving about a rotation axis, are vectors that lie along the rotation axis. The direction of these vectors is determined by a right-hand rule
- Torque is also a vector whose direction s determined by a right-hand rule. If the object is free to rotate around an axis, the torque around that axis points along that axis.

# 11-4
- For an object in a circular orbit, the orbital speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius. The square of the orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of the orbital radius.
- The total mechanical energy E for an object in a circular orbit is negative. The larger the orbital radius, the greater (less negative) the value of E.
- Kepler's three laws of planetary motion -- the law of orbits, the law of areas , and the law of periods -- were deduced from observation of how the planets move, but can all be explained by Newton's law of universal gravitation and are made mathematically easier to understand using conservation of energy and angular momentum.
