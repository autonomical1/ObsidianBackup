 Magnetism
- A magnet free to pivot is a **compass**
- Like poles repel, unlike poles attract
- *Magnetic poles and electric charges share some similar behavior, but they are not the same*

# The Magnetic Field
- *Every magnet sets up a magnetic field in the space around it*
- Symbol: $\overrightarrow{B}$
	- represents strength/magnitude of field

# Measuring the Magnetic Field
- An electric dipole rotates to line up with the electric field
	- electric dipole experiences a torque when placed in an electric field
- The compass, a magnetic dipole, rotates so that its north pole points in the direction of the magnetic field.
	- A magnetic field exerts a torque on the compass needle, causing the needle to point in the field direction
- Iron filings allow you to see the magnetic field lines
- *Magnetic field of a magnet points away from the north pole and toward the south pole*
### Magnetic Field Vectors and Field Lines
- **Magnetic field vector**: useful to represent the magnetic field at one particular point
- **Magnetic field lines**: overall representation of the field
	- can close in on each other and form loops

### The Magnetic Field of the Earth
- *The south pole of the earth's magnet is located near - not exactly coincident with - the earth's south end*

# Electric Currents also create Magnetic Fields
- Compass with react to the presence of a bar magnet
	- will also deflect if you place the compass near a wire and pass a current through the wire. 
- Magnetic field lines form circles around the wire. Magnetic force strength decreases as distance from wire increases.

- Magnetic field lines curve through the center of the look and back through the loop's center, forming complete closed curves. The field lines far from loop look like field lines from a bar magnet.

- Magnetic field lines due to currents have no start or end, they  form complete closed curves
- Ordinary magnets are often called permanent magnets to distinguish between electromagnets.
### Magnetic Field of a Straight, Current Carrying Wire
- **Right-Hand Rule of Fields**

### Calculating the Magnetic Field due to a Current
- Magnetic field strengths are measured in **Tesla**, T
- The magnitude of the magnetic field around a long, straight current-carrying wire depends on the distance r from the wire and the *current* I through the wire:
	- $$B = \frac{\mu_{0}I}{2\pi r}$$(Magnetic field due to a long, straight current-carrying wire)
	- $\mu_0$ is the **permeability constant**. It relates the strength of the magnetic field to the currents that produce it.
		- $\mu_{0} = 1.26 * 10^{-6}$ $T \cdot m/A$ $= 4\pi * 10^{-7}$ $T\cdot \frac{m}{A}$
### Magnetic Fields from More than One Source
- The total magnetic field at any point is the vector sum of the individual fields at that point. This is the principle of superposition.
### Current Loops
- The magnetic field due to a current loop is more complex than that of a straight wire.
- Because the loop can be thought of as a wire bent into a circle, the expression for the strength of the field at the center of the loop is similar to that of a wire.
- $$B = \frac{\mu_{0}I}{2R}$$(Magnetic field at the center of a current loop of radius R)
- If N loops of wire carrying the same current I are all tightly wound into a single flat coil, then the magnitude of the field at the center is just N times bigger (since we're imposing N individual current loops):
	- $$B = \frac{\mu_{0}NI}{2R}$$
### Solenoids
- The field inside a solenoid is fairly uniform.
- The greater the ratio of N turns of wire to the length L of the solenoid (N/L), the stronger the field inside will be. 
- The strength of the field will also be proportional to the current. The field does not depend on the radius of the solenoid.
- $$B = \frac{\mu_{0}NI}{L} = \mu_{0}nI$$

### Magnetic Fields exert forces on moving charges
- Magnetic fields also exert forces on moving charged particles and on electric currents in wires
- If charge is stationary or moves parallel to a magnetic field, there is no magnetic force
- As the angle $\alpha$ between the velocity and the magnetic field increases, the magnetic force also increases. The force is greatest when the angle is 90$\degree$ The magnetic force is always perpendicular to the plane containing $\overrightarrow{v}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$

### Paths of Charged Particles in Magnetic Fields
- A particle moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field undergoes uniform circular motion at constant speed.
- $$F = \frac{mv^{2}}{r}$$ to $$F = |q|vB = \frac{mv^{2}}{r}$$
- to$$r = \frac{mv}{|q|B}$$
### The Form of Magnetic Force on a Current
- We learned that the magnetic field exerts no force on a charged particle moving parallel to a magnetic field.
- If a current-carrying wire is parallel to a magnetic field, the force is also zero.
- The length of the wire *L*, the current *I*, and the magnetic field *B* affect the magnitude of the force on the wire:$$F_{wire} = ILB \cdot \sin \alpha$$
- When the wire is perpendicular to the field, $\alpha = 90 \deg$ so:
		$$F_{wire} = ILB$$
### Forces Between Currents
- Because a current produced a magnetic field, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current, it follows that two current-carrying wires will exert forces on each other.
- A wire carrying a current $I_1$ will create a magnetic field $\overrightarrow{B_{1}}$ 
- A second wire with current $I_{2}$ will experience the magnetic force due to the wire with current $I_{1}$.
- Using the right-hand rule for forces, we can see that when $I_{2}$ is in the same direction as $I_{1}$, the second wire is attracted to the first one.
- If they were in opposite directions, the second wire would be repelled. 
### Forces between Current Loops
- Just as there is an attractive force between parallel wires that have currents in the same direction, there is an attractive force between parallel loops in the same direction.
- There is a repulsive force between parallel loops with currents in opposite directions.
- Current loop, like a bar magnet, is a magnetic dipole.

### Ferromagnetism
- Materials that are strongly attracted to a magnet and that can be magnetized is called **ferromagnetic**
- Magnetism, at an atomic level, is due to the *inherent magnetic moment* of electrons.
- In most atoms with many electrons, the electrons occur in pairs with magnetic moments in opposite directions.
- Unpaired electrons are able to give an atom a net magnetic moment.
- For most elements whose atoms have magnetic moments, the moments are randomly arranged when the atoms join together to form a solid, so there is no net magnetism.
### Induced Magnetic Moments
- Ferromagnetic materials can get temporary alignments of fields. 
- HDDs work by changing the lengths of the magnets in the disks.
### Induced Currents
- We now know that a current can create a magnetic field.
- Michael Faraday experimented with two coils of wire wrapped around an iron ring in an attempt to generate a current from a magnetic field
- **Changing magnetic fields create current**
- Faraday placed one coil directly above the other, without the iron ring
	- there was no current in the lower circuit in the closed position, there was a momentary induced current
- Faraday found that there is a current in a coil of wire if an d only if the magnetic field passing through the coil is changing.

# Motional emf
- As a conductor moves through a uniform B, the charge carriers inside the conductor also move with the same velocity.
- The charge carriers feel a force = qvB. 
- Forces on the charge carriers in a moving conductor cause a charge separation that creates an electric field in the conductor. 
- The charge separation continues until the electric force equals the magnetic force:$$F_{e} = qE = F_{B} = qvB$$
- **The magnetic force on the charge carriers in a moving conductor creates an electric field $E = vB$ inside the conductor.**
