# 25.1
### Motional emf
- As a conductor moves through a uniform B, the charge carriers inside the conductor also move with the same velocity.
- The charge carriers feel a force = qvB. 
- Forces on the charge carriers in a moving conductor cause a charge separation that creates an electric field in the conductor. 
- The charge separation continues until the electric force equals the magnetic force:$$F_{e} = qE = F_{B} = qvB$$
- **The magnetic force on the charge carriers in a moving conductor creates an electric field $E = vB$ inside the conductor.**
- Motion of the wire through a magnetic field *induces* a potential difference between the ends of the conductor:$$\Delta V = vlB$$
- **Motional emf of a conductor moving perpendicular to the magnetic field**:$$\epsilon = vlB$$
### Induced current in a circuit
- A moving conductor could have an emf, but it could not sustain a current because the charges had no where to go. 
- The current in a circuit with a moving conductor is an induced current. 
- Current in circuit is induced when moving wire acts like a battery:
	- $$I = \frac{\epsilon}{r} = \frac{vlB}{r}$$
	- induced current I creates induced magnetic field which creates magnetic force
	- ![[Pasted image 20230214144025.png]]
	- $F_{pull}$ comes from some force causing the conductor to move, creating an induced current.
	- $$F_{pull}= F_{mag} = IlB = (\frac{vlB}{r})lB = \frac{vl^{2}b^{2}}{R}$$
### Generators
- Device that converts mechanical energy to electric energy

# 25.3 - Magnetic Flux
- Faraday found that a current was induced when the amount of magnetic field passing through a coil or look changes.
- This is what happens when we slide a wire along a rail
- The magnetic field passing through a loop is also affected by the tipping of the loop.
- The effective area:
	- $$A_{eff} = ab cos \theta = A cos \theta$$
- Magnetic flux: $\phi_{b}$ 
	- $$\phi_{B} = \overrightarrow{A} \cdot \overrightarrow{B}$$
	- $$\phi_{B}= A \cdot B \cdot \cos \theta$$
- The **magnetic flux** depends on the strength of field and the effective area of the loop:
	- $$\phi = A_{eff} B = AB \cos \theta$$
	- SI Unit: Weber
	- 1 weber = 1 Wb = 1 T $\cdot$ $m^2$
### Lenz's Law
- **Current is induced in a loop of wire when the magnetic flux through the loop changes**
- Motion is not required to induce a current
