### The Form of Magnetic Force on a Current
- We learned that the magnetic field exerts no force on a charged particle moving parallel to a magnetic field.
- If a current-carrying wire is parallel to a magnetic field, the force is also zero.
- The length of the wire *L*, the current *I*, and the magnetic field *B* affect the magnitude of the force on the wire:$$F_{wire} = ILB \cdot \sin \alpha$$
- When the wire is perpendicular to the field, $\alpha = 90 \deg$ so:
		$$F_{wire} = ILB$$
### Forces Between Currents
- Because a current produced a magnetic field, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current, it follows that two current-carrying wires will exert forces on each other.
- A wire carrying a current $I_1$ will create a magnetic field $\overrightarrow{B_{1}}$ 
- A second wire with current $I_{2}$ will experience the magnetic force due to the wire with current $I_{1}$.
- Using the right-hand rule for forces, we can see that when $I_{2}$ is in the same direction as $I_{1}$, the second wire is attracted to the first one.
- If they were in opposite directions, the second wire would be repelled. 
### Forces between Current Loops
- Just as there is an attractive force between parallel wires that have currents in the same direction, there is an attractive force between parallel loops in the same direction.
- There is a repulsive force between parallel loops with currents in opposite directions.
- Current loop, like a bar magnet, is a magnetic dipole.

### Ferromagnetism
- Materials that are strongly attracted to a magnet and that can be magnetized is called **ferromagnetic**
- Magnetism, at an atomic level, is due to the *inherent magnetic moment* of electrons.
- In most atoms with many electrons, the electrons occur in pairs with magnetic moments in opposite directions.
- Unpaired electrons are able to give an atom a net magnetic moment.
- For most elements whose atoms have magnetic moments, the moments are randomly arranged when the atoms join together to form a solid, so there is no net magnetism.
### Induced Magnetic Moments
- Ferromagnetic materials can get temporary alignments of fields. 
- HDDs work by changing the lengths of the magnets in the disks.
### Induced Currents
- We now know that a current can create a magnetic field.
- Michael Faraday experimented with two coils of wire wrapped around an iron ring in an attempt to generate a current from a magnetic field
- **Changing magnetic fields create current**
- Faraday placed one coil directly above the other, without the iron ring
	- there was no current in the lower circuit in the closed position, there was a momentary induced current
- Faraday found that there is a current in a coil of wire if an d only if the magnetic field passing through the coil is changing.

### Motional emf
- As a conductor moves through a uniform B, the charge carriers inside the conductor also move with the same velocity.
- The charge carriers feel a force = qvB. 
- Forces on the charge carriers in a moving conductor cause a charge separation that creates an electric field in the conductor. 
- The charge separation continues until the electric force equals the magnetic force:$$F_{e} = qE = F_{B} = qvB$$
- **The magnetic force on the charge carriers in a moving conductor creates an electric field $E = vB$ inside the conductor.**
- Motion of the wire through a magnetic field *induces* a potential difference between the ends of the conductor:$$\Delta V = vlB$$
- **Motional emf of a conductor moving perpendicular to the magnetic field**:$$\epsilon = vlB$$
### Induced current in a circuit
- A moving conductor could have an emf, but it could not sustain a current because the charges had no where to go. 
- The current in a circuit with a moving conductor is an induced current.
