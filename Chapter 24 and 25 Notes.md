### Motional emf
- As a conductor moves through a uniform B, the charge carriers inside the conductor also move with the same velocity.
- The charge carriers feel a force = qvB. 
- Forces on the charge carriers in a moving conductor cause a charge separation that creates an electric field in the conductor. 
- The charge separation continues until the electric force equals the magnetic force:$$F_{e} = qE = F_{B} = qvB$$
- **The magnetic force on the charge carriers in a moving conductor creates an electric field $E = vB$ inside the conductor.**
- Motion of the wire through a magnetic field *induces* a potential difference between the ends of the conductor:$$\Delta V = vlB$$
- **Motional emf of a conductor moving perpendicular to the magnetic field**:$$\epsilon = vlB$$
### Induced current in a circuit
- A moving conductor could have an emf, but it could not sustain a current because the charges had no where to go. 
- The current in a circuit with a moving conductor is an induced current.
