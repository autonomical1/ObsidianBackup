### Magnetic Fields from More than One Source
- The total magnetic field at any point is the vector sum of the individual fields at that point. This is the principle of superposition.
### Current Loops
- The magnetic field due to a current loop is more complex than that of a straight wire.
- Because the loop can be thought of as a wire bent into a circle, the expression for the strength of the field at the center of the loop is similar to that of a wire.
- $$B = \frac{\mu_{0}I}{2R}$$(Magnetic field at the center of a current loop of radius R)
- If N loops of wire carrying the same current I are all tightly wound into a single flat coil, then the magnitude of the field at the center is just N times bigger (since we're imposing N individual current loops):
	- $$B = \frac{\mu_{0}NI}{2R}$$
### Solenoids
- The field inside a solenoid is fairly uniform.
- The greater the ratio of N turns of wire to the length L of the solenoid (N/L), the stronger the field inside will be. 
- The strength of the field will also be proportional to the current. The field does not depend on the radius of the solenoid.
- $$B = \frac{\mu_{0}NI}{L} = \mu_{0}nI$$
