**Series Resistors**:
- Equivalent resistance of resistors in series $$R_{eq} = R_{1} + R_{2} + ... + R_{n}$$
- Amount of current depends both on battery's emf and resistance of the circuit attached to the battery

**Parallel Resistors**:
- when circuit elements are connected at both ends to the entire circuit
-
