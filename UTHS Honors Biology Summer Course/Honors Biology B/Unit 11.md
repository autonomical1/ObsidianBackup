### Unit 11, Lesson 1 (HON BIO B)
1. Charles Darwin was a well-to-do man that travelled the world on the H.M.S. Beagle who posited the theory of natural selection, which is where the population in a certain area will adapt to the environment. He did this by studying different species of finches on the Galapagos Islands. These finches all had differing beak shapes based on the food sources on the islands on which they were located. This led Darwin to believe that the finches had evolved to have their beak shapes conform to what food sources were available.
2. This theory of natural selection is overwhelmingly important in almost any kind of scenario. In my home, there are birds that nest on a very high roof, and the baby birds that are unable to fly fall to their death, which is a form of natural selection, since they were not suited to live and reproduce.
3. I found it really interesting how Darwin got this groundbreaking discovery using the different beak shapes of finches, and how he was able to do it while travelling the world. It is also interesting how those finches that were most likely based on the mainland travelled to the different islands and changed overtime.
