### Unit 10, Lesson 2 (HON BIO B)
1. The fossil record is one of the primary forms of evidence used by scientists to prove the Theory of Evolution. Much information can come from studying the age of fossils and where they are located. Fossils are the remains or imprints of a once-living organism that have been preserved in rock. They are formed over large periods of time. Scientists can determine the approximate age of a fossil based on the location inside the rock, as well as how deep it is in the ground, which allows them to get a relative age of the organism. Another form of determining the age of a fossil is absolute dating, which is primarily done using carbon dating, where the decay of carbon atoms are used to determine how old the material is, which can provide evidence for common ancestry, as well as developing a chronology for the process of evolution.
2. I went to a park in my city that had dinosaur footprints and real dinosaur fossils. The paleontologists that found those fossils used the fossil record and processes like carbon dating to generate a timeline for how old and when the dinosaur evolved.
3. I knew the general idea of evolution before this unit and how fossils were used to show different ages and generations of organisms, but I didn't realize that there was such a way to calculate the numerical age of a organism using carbon dating.
