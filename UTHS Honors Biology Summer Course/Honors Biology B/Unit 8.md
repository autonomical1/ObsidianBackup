### Unit 8, Lesson 4 (HON BIO B)
1. For certain traits in organisms, the pattern of inheritance that is normally observed and proven by Mendel's work is not normally followed. An example of this is how human offspring inherit the blood types from their parents. Blood types are based on 3 alleles that code for type A, B, and O blood. A and B alleles are dominant, and O alleles are recessive. Another form of "Non-Mendelian Inheritance" is incomplete dominance, where the two alleles from the parents are neither dominant or recessive, so the offspring exhibit both phenotypes. Another form is codominance, where both alleles are equally expressed, which can be seen in chicken feathers, where they can be both colors from the mother and father. Some traits can also appear in one gender more than the other, and this is called a sex-linked trait. Since females have 2 X chromosomes, and men have 1 X and 1 Y chromosome, some traits are exhibited in those chromosomes. An example of this is hemophilia in humans, where women can be carriers of the disease, since they have 2 X chromosomes, so one can be normal, and one can be a recessive carrier.
2. I knew about how blood types worked, and what both of my parents' blood types are, so using this information, I can get a better idea of what my blood type is. The only issue with this is the fact that I don't know if they have the O allele, which is recessive.
3. I found it really interesting how only women have the capability of carrying certain diseases, while not exhibiting any of the traits, and the fact that it may not even be exhibited in their offspring for multiple generations, since they could get "lucky" and pass down the carrier genes.
