- Carolus Linneaus regarded as the Father of Taxonomic Botany
	- known for creating a system for classifying plants based on the number of reproductive parts
	- also helped establish a naming system for living organisms
		- known as binomial nomenclature - each organism named using two words, (genus) + specific epithet (species)
- **Taxonomy**: study of classifying and naming organisms according to their similarities and differences.
	- organisms placed into hierarchal categories that are increasingly more specific
	- 8 main levels of organization (taxa) in basic taxonomy
