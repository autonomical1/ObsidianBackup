- The characteristics of life: 
	- composed of cells
	- use energy
	- contain DNA
	- grow and develop
	- reproduce
	- maintain homeostasis
	- adapt and evolve
	- respond to stimuli
- Ways that organisms differ (useful in catergorization)
	- cell type: prokaryote vs. eukaryote
	- number of cells: unicellular vs. multicellular
		- bacteria are unicellular, most eukaryotes are multicellular
		- prokaryotes are all unicellular
	- mode of nutrition: autotroph vs. heterotroph
	- cell composition: cell wall vs. no cell wall
		- prokaryotic bacteria, plants, and fungi have cell walls
	- ability to move: motile vs. non-motile
		- some move freely and spontaneously at some point - *motile*
		- plants can't move on their own - *non-motile*

- All life can be categorized into one of 3 domains: *Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya*

#### Domain Archaea
- bacteria that live in extremely violent, hostile environments
- hypothesized that they were the first organisms to evolve on this planet
- can be further categorized based on the specific environments they favor
	- *thermophiles* - extreme temps
	- *acidophiles* - very acidic environments
	- *halophiles* - very salty environments
- unicellular, prokaryotic, and have cell walls
- can be either autotrophic or heterotrophic
- **Kingdom Archaebacteria**:
	- only kingdom in Domain Archaea
	- archaea = ancient

#### Domain Bacteria
- appear almost everywhere on the planet
- prokaryotic, unicellular organisms
- smallest organisms on Earth
- 3 basic shapes:
	- coccus (sphere-shaped)
	- bacillus (rod-shaped)
	- spirillus (spiral)
- can be either autotrophs or heterotrophs
- cyanobacteria
	- autotrophic
	- thought to be the first photosynthesizers on earth
- many ecological processes depend on them
- help digestive processes for many organisms
- some are pathogenic and act as parasites
- **Kingdom Eubacteria**:
	- only kingdom in bacteria
	- refers to the fact that bacteria in this kingdom are extremely common and exist almost everywhere

#### Domain Eukarya
- includes all eukaryotic organisms
- most diverse of the domains
- can be subdivided into 4 different kingdoms based on size, motility, cell composition, and mode of nutrition
- evolved much more recently than other organisms
- larger and more complex
- **Kingdom Protista**:
	- small compared to other eukaryotes
	- mostly unicellular
		- still 10x larger than prokaryotic cells
	- includes amoebas, paramecia, molds, algae, etc.
	- some form colonies
	- most protists don't contain cell wall, some do
	- some are parasitic and can infect other organisms
	- can live in almost any environment that contains liquid water
- **Kingdom Plantae**:
	- autotrophic producers in environment
	- multicellular
	- contain cell wall that is used for structure and support
		- made of cellulose
	- contain photosynthetic chloroplasts
	- non-motile
	- important to carbon and nitrogen cycles
	- includes all trees, grasses, flowers, tubers, ferns, and mosses
	- rely on sunlight and environment to perform photosynthesis
- **Kingdom Fungi**:
	- decomposing heterotrophs
	- contain cell wall for structure and support
		- made of chitin (exoskeletons of arthropods also made of chitin)
	- don't contain chloroplasts
	- multicellular, also has unicellular yeast
	- non-motile
	- referred to as absorptive heterotrophs since they decompose organic matter in the environment and digest it outside of their bodies
	- some are parasitic and can cause infection
	- includes all mushrooms and yeasts
- **Kingdom Animalia**:
	- heterotrophic consumers
	- don't have cell wall or chloroplasts
	- ingestive heterotrophs - ingest food and digest it inside their bodies
	- some are parasitic
	- includes all sponges, coral, insects, fish, etc
