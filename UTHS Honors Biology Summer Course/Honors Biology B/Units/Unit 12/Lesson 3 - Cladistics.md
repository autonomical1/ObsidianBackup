- millions of known species of organisms
- some organisms that used to exist, that don't anymore - **extinct**
- many fossils have been found of extinct organisms

- **Phylogeny**: study of the evolutionary history of life and the relationships between groups of organisms that determine their relatedness
	- evaluate and compare molecular homologies to determine how recently they share a common ancestor
- all life shares a common ancestor

### Clades and Evolutionary Trees
- taxonomists often observe homologous structures and organize them according to a system called **cladistics**
- sorts organisms into *clades* - groups of organisms that descended from a common ancestor
- determined by a characteristic that the organisms share
- **cladograms**: charts that organize clades into representation of history of life
- molecular homology shows how closely related species are
- can vary in size depending on the characteristic being looked at
