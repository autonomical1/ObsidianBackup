1. Both populations will begin to die out due to no water
2. Some traits from both populations will merge to create a better hybrid population


- Non-selective processes like migration, mutation, and random changes can also contribute to evolution of species

### Genetic Drift
- some changes caused by random chance - only by chance will some individuals reproduce at higher rates than others
- the individuals that may pass down their genes to their offspring may not be the best suited or adapted to their environment
	- right place at the right time
- large impact when population is small
	- natural disasters can cause decreasing population size - result = bottleneck - large portion of population wiped out and only a small number remain
	- gene pool begins to reflect the smaller subset of original population due to decreasing genetic diversity

### Gene Flow
- individuals migrate into a population and mate with the native organisms
- changes gene pool of the area leading to evolution
- readily seen when two populations are separated by a physical barrier

### Mutation
- one of the ultimate sources of evolutionary change
- random changes can accumulate over time and can cause major changes
- can also be harmful - this will be eliminated from population over time
