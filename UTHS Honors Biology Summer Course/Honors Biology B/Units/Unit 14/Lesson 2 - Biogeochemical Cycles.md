- Carbon is the basis for all life on Earth.
	- in all macromolecules
	- CO2
	- photosynthetic organisms take in CO2
- **Biogeochemical cycle**: the way carbon enters organisms, exchanged between them, and is returned to the atmosphere

- **Nitrogen Cycle**:
	- chemical makeup of air:
		- ![[Pasted image 20230728184424.png]]
		- most of the air is nitrogen
		- important component of DNA, RNA, and proteins.

		- balance within N cycle is important since organisms need usable source of N to make nucleic and amino acids, but too much N can wash into water supplies.
		- microorganisms "fix" the nitrogen
			- **nitrogen fixing** - chemical reaction that some microorganisms do that converts N2 to usable compounds like nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia
				- live in a symbiotic relationship with legume plants.
