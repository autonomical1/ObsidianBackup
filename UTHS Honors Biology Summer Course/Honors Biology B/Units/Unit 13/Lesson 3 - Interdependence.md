- food webs and chains show predator-prey interaction
	- **predation**: predator species capture and feed on prey species
		- regulate size and growth of prey population to maintain homeostasis at ecosystem level
- **symbiosis** - close interdependent relationship between 2 species
	- 1. Mutualism
		- both species benefit
		- ex: oxpecker bird landing on zebra, bird eats ticks and parasites off zebra, zebras get pest control, birds get food
	- 2. Commensalism
		- one species benefits while the other is neither harmed or helped
			- woodpeckers in cacti
	- 3. Parasitism
		- one species benefits, one serves as host and is harmed
			- parasites benefit
			- don't immediately kill host
