- one way organisms get energy is by consuming other organisms
	- can be described by what they eat - carnivores, herbivores, omnivores
- energy enters ecosystems through autotrophs (plants, some protists and bacteria)
	- capture energy and store it into macromolecules
	- photosynthesis vs chemosynthesis
- heterotrophs are not able to capture and store light/chemical energy - therefore they depend on autotrophs for energy and nutrients
- energy enters from producers and flows from producer to consumer
- food chains show how organisms transfer energy and matter by consumption from one trophic level to the next.

- primary consumers consume producers, secondary consumers consume primary consumers, and then it goes on

	- food web shows interdependent network of feeding interactions
	- collection of food chains that interlock
- scavengers (vultures) hunt and feed on dead plant/animal material
- decomposers - consume dead plants and animals, break down nutrients to return to the environment
