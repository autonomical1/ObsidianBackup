- lots of info can be gained from studying fossils and where they are located
- one of the primary forms of evidence to prove theory of evolution
- **fossil**: remains or imprint of a once-living organism that has hardened into a cast by a rock
	- formed over long periods of time
	- earth around dead organism begins to compact and harden into rock, solidifying its location

- scientists can also determine approximate age of organisms using its location within the rock/type of rock it was found in
	- simplest form: *relative dating*
		- technique based on depth in ground and type of rock it was found in
		- does not produce a numerical age
		- the deeper the fossil is in layers of rock, the older it is
		- ![[Pasted image 20230724171510.png|300]]
- **Absolute Dating**: much more complicated method of dating
	- uses decay of carbon atoms found in the fossil to calculate the numerical age
	- primary method: *carbon dating*
	- the more decayed the atoms are, the older it is - the amount of decay is how old the fossil is
- Determining age plays huge role in providing evidence for evolution
- can also provide evidence of common ancestry - many different species can all come from one older species

### Vestigial Structures
- fossil structure can determine evolutionary changes
- **structure in an organism that currently serves no purpose but once thought to play a role in organism's survival**
- ex: muscles around ears - once used to hear around for predators approaching, but now has no use
	- also, bones in front of tail fins in whales which are believed to be remnants of hip bones

- I used the differing methods of spray devices to represent the layers of the fossil record.
- The different types of spray bottles showed the different organisms.
- I was able to show how the bottles became smaller, and the spraying device became smaller and more compact, with different types of spraying for different uses.
