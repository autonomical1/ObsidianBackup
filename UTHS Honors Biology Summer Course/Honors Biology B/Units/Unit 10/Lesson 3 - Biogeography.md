- islands are useful to study for biogeography due to their isolation
- The Theory of Island Biogeography originally explained how species came to be distributed across oceanic islands
	- The farther away an island is from the mainland, the less diverse it will be due to lower immigration rates - "Distance Effect"
	- The larger the island is, the more diverse it will be
		- larger immigration rate because it is easier to land on a large piece of land
		- larger islands have lower extinction rates because more space = larger populations - less vulnerable

### Lab

- **Hypothesis**: The island that is large and near will have the most diversity, then the small and near island, then the large and far, and then finally, the small and far with the least diversity.

|---|---|---|---|---|
|Island|Bean|Cotton Ball|Safety Pin|Bolt|
|Large, Near|9|9|3|11|
|Large, Far|2|3|8|2|
|Small, Near|3|8|4|2|
|Small, Far|11|0|2|2|

1. My hypothesis for the large and near, and small and far were the most correct. The large and far island had a surprisingly small amount of diversity, and the small and near island had more than expected diversity.
2. I conducted the experiment on tile, so the bounciness of the items I used to throw increased their travel distance, and there were also spaces in the tile, where the movement of the items were affected.
3. The large and near island had the most amount of diversity and greatest species richness.
4. This is evidence of evolution, because the organisms that are represented by these items will evolve based on what is available on those islands.
- **Biogeography**: study of geographic distribution of organisms
	- with this, we can study evolution by tracking relationship between changes occurring with organisms on earth and changes of the Earth itself.
- ~200M years ago, one continent on Earth - Pangaea. Due to movement in tectonic plates, Pangaea separated into smaller landmasses known as the 7 continents today

- landmasses separated by water or mountains -> geographic isolation of organisms -> evolution into their own species over time
- explains appearance of new organisms over time
- fossils can also support biogeography, since fossils can be found for the same organisms in multiple different places - suggests that the common ancestor once found in both areas
