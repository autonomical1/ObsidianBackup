- Steps to solve a dihybrid cross
	- Identify which allele is dominant and recessive
	- Write the corresponding phenotype for each allele
	- Write the parents' genotypes
	- Number the alleles for the mother and father (1-4)
		- YYRR and yyrr
		- 1234 and 1234
	- Draw 4x4 punnett square
	- Write mother's alleles for numbers 1+3, 1+4, 2+3, and 2+4 above the columns
		- YR, YR, YR, YR
	- Write father's alleles for numbers 1+3, 1+4, 2+3, and 2+4 next to rows
		- yr, yr, yr, yr
	- Fill in punnett squares
	- Write dominant before recessive
