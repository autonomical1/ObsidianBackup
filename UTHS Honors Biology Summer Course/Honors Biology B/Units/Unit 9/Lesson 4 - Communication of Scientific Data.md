## Scientific Journals

Scientists monitor themselves and their research through a _peer review_ process. In this process, the research is provided to other scientists and qualified experts in that area of science so that they can check that the research is both clear and correct.

Another way that scientific research is monitored is through a _clinical trial_. This is a type of experiment where products, particularly medicines are tested on animals or people. These trials occur only if the product has been well researched and tested in a laboratory situation. The results are used to determine decide whether the product can be sold to the public.
