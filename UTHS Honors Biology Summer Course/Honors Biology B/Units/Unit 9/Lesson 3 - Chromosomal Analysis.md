### Chromosome Painting
- human body cell contains 46 chromosomes - 23 from mom, 23 from dad
- ![[Pasted image 20230721170913.jpg]]
	- nucleus removed from fetal cell in mitosis, chromosomes spread out; separated based on length, then exposed to fluorescent stains to differentiate between pairs of chromosomes - results in image known as **karyotype**
- used to identify chromosome abnormalities and aberrations from single cell
- to construct a karyotype, cells collected from blood sample, then isolated cells stimulated to begin cell division.
	- a chemical is added after cell division starts to stop chromosomes from dividing
	- hypotonic solution added so cells swell and spread apart
	- cells preserved in fixative and applied to a slide
	- chromosomes then are stained so geneticist can visualize bands on chromosomes
	- identified by banding patterns, size, centromere location
	- arranged in pairs longest to shortest
- used to detect genetic abnormalities that cause Down and Turner Syndrome
- Down syndrome - third copy of chromosome 21, Turner Syndrome is absence of 1 X chromosome in women
- Karyotypes can also show improperly altered or changed chromosomes
- 4 ways:
	- Deletions: absence of parts of a chromosome
	- Translocations: occur when a segment of one chromosome breaks off of one and attaches to another
	- Inversions: order of genes in a section of chromosomes are reversed - mostly silent and don't cause abnormalities
	- Duplications: segment of chromosome copied more than once and inserted on the same chromosome
