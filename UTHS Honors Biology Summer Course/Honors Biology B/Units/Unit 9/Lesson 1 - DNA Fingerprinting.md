### DNA Fingerprinting Lab

1. Sample B matched with the sample found at the crime scene.
2. There were more than 3 sections that matched with the initial sample.
3. Shorter strands of DNA move quicker through the gel, which allows strands to be ordered based on size.

- comparison of specific sections of two or more DNA samples
- every person's genome contains sections of repeated DNA sequences - the number of times these sequences repeated change
- 3 Steps of fingerprinting:
	- DNA Extraction - opening of cells to separate/isolate DNA from other cell parts
		- chemical treatment causes cells and nuclei to burst
		- DNA inherently sticky and can be pulled out of mixture
			- called spooling DNA
	- DNA cutting - Large DNA molecules cut into smaller fragments using restriction enzymes
		- recognize and cut DNA at specific sequences
		- some cut straight across leaving blunt ends, some cut within DNA molecule leave behind tails or sticky ends
	- Separating DNA - can be separated and analyzed using gel electrophoresis

### Gel Electrophoresis
- DNA fragments separated based on size and charge
- phosphate groups negatively charged
- DNA placed in gel, electricity runs through it, creating a positive and negative end, where negatively charged DNA moves toward positive
- Smaller fragments move farther and faster.

### Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
- amplifies (makes copies) of DNA
- clones DNA fragments to be used to analyze genetic diseases, genetic sequencing and studying genetic diseases.
- 3 step process - uses 4 materials: DNA that is copied, DNA polymerase, copies of DNA nucleotides, ATCG, and 2 primers
	- primer is a short piece of DNA that provides starting place for new strands
	- steps:
		- Separating/Denaturation
		- Binding/Annealing
		- Copying/DNA synthesis

### Genomics
- study of genomes of organisms
	- **genome** - complete set of genes/genetic material found in an organism
	- studied to compare similarities and differences across species
- allows for identification of disease causing genes, interactions, and evolutionary relationships

### DNA Sequencing
- finding the order of nucleotides in genomes
- models of organisms used for studying gene functions and disorders 

### Human Genome Project
- launched in 1990 to study human genome
- two goals:
	- map and sequence all DNA base pairs found in human genome
	- identify all genes within sequence
