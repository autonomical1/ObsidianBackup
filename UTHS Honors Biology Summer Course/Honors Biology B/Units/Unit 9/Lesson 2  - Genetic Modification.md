### Genetically Modified Organisms
- insertion of segment of DNA foreign to the host DNA
	- this is called **recombinant DNA**
	- cut DNA from 2 different organisms with same restriction enzyme and combine them - used for genetic engineering
	- cell transcribes and translates new DNA to make proteins
		- this is even used to create insulin for diabetic patients by inserting the gene for that protein into bacteria
- *Genetic engineering* - process of changing organism's traits using recombinant DNA
- most common - molecular cloning

### Gene Cloning
- isolation and copy-making of genes
- can be used to isolate and make copies of a gene for gene therapy
- 4 steps: 
	- *isolation*: restriction enzyme breaks DNA at specific base sequence - used to isolate a specific gene of interest. 
	- *ligation*: DNA ligase combines isolated gene with plasmid DNA from bacteria 
		- plasmid - circular DNA not part of chromosome, can replicate independently

	- *transformation*: recombinant DNA inserted into living cell - usually a bacterial cell
	- *selection*: growing transformed bacteria to make sure they have recombinant DNA - transformation not always successful

### Reproductive Cloning
- whole organism is cloned/identical copy is made
- in sexually reproducing organisms, during cloning, haploid nucleus of egg cell replaced with diploid nucleus of cell of another organism of same species (donor).
	- results in zygote that is genetically identical to donor
	- this is **somatic cell transfer**

### Biotechnology in Animals and Plants
- Transgenic plants and animals commonplace due to GE
	- desired genes first cloned, then placed in animals
	- mice used to study effect of mutations and recombinant genes
	- plants bred for desirable traits like herbicide and pesticide resistance


### Biotechnology in Medicine
- Genetic testing - process of testing for suspected genetic defects
	- many ppl get it while pregnant to make sure diseases not passed down 
- Gene therapy used to cure disease
	- good gene inserted into genome of organism to aid in cure of disease caused by mutated gene
- Antibiotics, hormones, and vaccines also made through GE; antibiotics naturally produced by fungi made by manipulating fungus to create many viable cultures of antibiotics
