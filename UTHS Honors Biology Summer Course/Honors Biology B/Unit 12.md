### Unit 12, Lesson 4 (HON BIO B)
1. There are 14 levels of organization that create the world and all of the living things in it. It starts at elements, which are the simplest substances on earth, where their identities are based on how one of its atoms are composed. Atoms combine to create molecules using chemical bonds. Larger molecules called macromolecules are created from many atoms. Macromolecules combine to form organelles. Organelles are the "organs" of the cell, which is the basic unit of life. In very complex organisms, cells combine to create specialized tissues, that carry out specific functions that help multicellular organisms survive. Tissues combine to form specialized organs. Organs work together to form organ systems. An example of this is the digestive system, which is composed of the mouth, stomach, and intestines. Organ systems combine to form an individual organism. Individual organisms living in the same place form a population, and a group of populations living in the same area are communities. Communities of organisms form an ecosystem, and a biome is composed of many ecosystems. The biosphere is a term that refers to all living things on Earth.
2. This organizational structure can be seen just by looking outside. Atoms combine to create the molecules and macromolecules that create the cells and organelles in grass, which combine to create tissues (roots and leaves) and these systems combine to create the organisms. All of the grass outside form a population, combined with trees and other greenery, create a community. The insects, birds, flowers, grass, bushes, trees, and other animals outside form an ecosystem.
3. I was honestly surprised that there was so many levels of organization, and the way that it can be seen just by looking outside. It still surprises me that the garden outside my house is home to so many organisms coinciding with each other, to create the ecosystems and communities and populations.
