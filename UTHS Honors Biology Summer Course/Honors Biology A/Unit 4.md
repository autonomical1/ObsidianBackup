### Unit 4, Lesson 3 ([[HON BIO A]])
1.  Cellular Respiration is the process of breaking down and converting glucose to ATP. The balanced equation for cellular respiration is : $C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6 H_2O + \text{ ATP}$. There are 3 different processes for producing ATP: Glycolysis, The Krebs Cycle (and Electron Transport Chain) and Fermentation. Glycolysis is a form of anaerobic respiration, which means it doesn't require oxygen, and it produces 2 pyruvate and 2 ATP molecules.; The Krebs Cycle and Electron Transport Chain is aerobic, which means that it requires oxygen, and it produces 34 ATP molecules. Fermentation is another form of anaerobic fermentation, and it produces 2 ATP molecules when oxygen is scarce. 
2. Recently, I did a workout where I did extremely intense weight lifting. I now understand why my muscles feel super sore after a few days, since the lactic acid buildup finally hit. My muscles would get oxygen deprived, since they required such a large amount of ATP and energy, so it reverted to using lactic acid fermentation. 
3. I found it pretty interesting that even if there is very little oxygen available, the body can create some amount of energy from what is available. I could see this in the lab, since even the control with no carbon dioxide barely sank.
