### Unit 7, Lesson 3 ([[HON BIO A]])
1. Plants reproduce in a similar way to animals, albeit with different processes and parts. They reproduce through the process of pollination, where the male gamete (pollen) is spread to the "female" parts of the plant. There are two types of pollination: cross-pollination where a pollinator (birds, bees, water, wind), and self-pollination, where the plant's male gametes fertilize the eggs. The male reproductive structure is called the stamen, which has the anther (which produces pollen) and the filament (which holds up the anther). The collective name for the female parts is the pistil. There are 4 parts in the pistil: the stigma (which catches the pollen grains), the style (which holds up stigma and connects it to the ovaries), the ovaries (contains female gametes awaiting fertilization), and the ovules (which develop into seeds when fertilized). 
2. Plants are everywhere and the way they reproduce is very important. Pollen is also an allergen, and it is always in the air, which is why it is so prominent. This also means that every plant can get pollinated via wind, which is so important for the reproduction of plants. I also don't really understand how oak trees pollinate and produce offspring - I've never seen the seeds.
3. I find it super interesting how there is pollen floating around everywhere, but not every flower gets pollinated. I also find it super interesting how the petals are only there to lure pollinators into the plant, so they can get both nutrition, while also allowing for the continuation of the species.
