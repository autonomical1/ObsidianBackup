## Structure and Function of Biomolecules

### Carbohydrates
- made of C, H, and O
- shaped like a hexagon

- monomer of carbohydrates is a **monosaccharide** (single-sugar)
- other types of sugar - disaccharides
	- for example, sucrose - combo of glucose and fructose
- polymer of carbohydrates - **polysaccharide**
	- usually in the form of starches
- **Function:** quick form of energy; converted to ATP for use in cells
- **Sources:** in most foods

### Lipids
- in the form of fatr
