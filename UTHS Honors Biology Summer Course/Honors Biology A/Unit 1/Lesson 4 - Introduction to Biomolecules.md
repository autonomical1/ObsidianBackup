## Structure and Function of Biomolecules

### Carbohydrates
- made of C, H, and O
- shaped like a hexagon
![[Pasted image 20230616214408.png]]

- *monomer* of carbohydrates is a **monosaccharide** (single-sugar)
- other types of sugar - disaccharides
	- for example, sucrose - combo of glucose and fructose
- *polymer* of carbohydrates - **polysaccharide**
	- usually in the form of starches
- **Function:** quick form of energy; converted to ATP for use in cells
- **Sources:** in most foods

### Lipids
- in the form of fats, oils, and waxes
- composed of C and H, can contain some O
- *monomer*: **triglyceride**
	- "tri" = 3
	- glycerol backbone with 3 fatty acid chains
- Two types:
	- Saturated:
		- fatty acid chains completely saturated with hydrogen, makes carbon chains completely straight and packed together
		- solid at room temp
		- ![[Pasted image 20230616215132.png]]
	- Unsaturated:
		- fatty acid chains not completely saturated with hydrogen, create double bonds between carbon atoms on chains.
		- molecules not packed as tightly together
		- ![[Pasted image 20230616215221.png]]
- Lipids are polymers of many triglyceride molecules that create larger molecules.
- **Phospholipids**: special type of lipid; distinct shape with round phosphate head and 2 fatty acid tails
	- ![[Pasted image 20230616215338.png]]
- **Function:** long-term energy storage; make up membranes that surrounds cells called cell membrane.
- **Sources:** Animal fat, etc.

### Proteins
- Structure: CHON
	- Change in shape of protein can change the protein in function![[Pasted image 20230616220953.png]]
- *monomer*: amino acid - 22 different types and many different combinations to create proteins.![[Pasted image 20230616220947.png]]
- amino acids bonded by peptide bonds - polypeptide chains
- **Function:** provide body with structure, movement of body, repairs cells, and allows movement of molecules
- **Sources:** meats, beans, dairy

### Nucleic Acids
- Structure: CHONP, made of nucleotides
	- nucleotide structure: sugar, phosphate group, nitrogen base
	- ![Nucleotide](https://cedu-spw-p06.austin.utexas.edu/canvas-files/BioA-66431/unit01/lsn04/U01L04EXN08.PNG)
- Two types: DNA and RNA
- DNA contains all of body's genetic information
	- Deoxyribonucleic acid
	- ![[Pasted image 20230616221037.png]]
- RNA is the molecule responsible for building all of the proteins.
	- Ribonucleic acid
- **Function:** DNA - genetic information and code for all proteins; RNA - proteins that our DNA codes for

1. The biscuits were found to have large amounts of simple sugars since the solution turned dark orange.
2. The biscuits and potato starch had carbohydrates due to the flour content.
3. The protein slurry had protein because the biuret solution turned purple.
4. The mustard oil was very saturated with lipids.
5. T
