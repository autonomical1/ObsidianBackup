	- monosaccharide

## Structure and Function of Biomolecules

### Carbohydrates
- made of C, H, and O
- shaped like a hexagon

- *monomer* of carbohydrates is a **monosaccharide** (single-sugar)
- other types of sugar - disaccharides
	- for example, sucrose - combo of glucose and fructose
- *polymer* of carbohydrates - **polysaccharide**
	- usually in the form of starches
- **Function:** quick form of energy; converted to ATP for use in cells
- **Sources:** in most foods

### Lipids
- in the form of fats, oils, and waxes
- composed of C and H, can contain some O
- *monomer*: **triglyceride**
	- "tri" = 3
	- glycerol backbone with 3 fatty acid chains
- Two types:
	- Saturated:
		- fatty acid chains completely saturated with hydrogen, makes carbon chains completely straight and packed together
		- solid at room temp

	- Unsaturated:
		- fatty acid chains not completely saturated with hydrogen, create double bonds between carbon atoms on chains.
		- molecules not packed as tightly together

- Lipids are polymers of many triglyceride molecules that create larger molecules.
- **Phospholipids**: special type of lipid; distinct shape with round phosphate head and 2 fatty acid tails

- **Function:** long-term energy storage; make up membranes that surrounds cells called cell
