### Unit 2, Lesson 4 (HON BIO A)
1. This lesson is about how viruses work and how they infect and destroy organisms. Viruses are not living organisms, since they do not follow one of the main postulates of the cell theory, which states that to be a cell, it must be able to replicate on its own, which is the opposite of what a virus requires.  Viruses replicate and infect other cells by taking over the cell processes of healthy cells. Viruses are composed of two main parts -- the capsid (protein coat) and the genetic material. It works kind of like the enzyme and substrate lock-and-key fit, by connecting itself to the cell via the receptor proteins. It disguises itself as a regular protein that the cell would need to do its job, but as soon as it injects its genetic material into the cell, it's essentially over for the cell. Viral reproduction can undergo 2 different cycles - lytic or lysogenic. The lytic cycle involves the virus using the cell's machinery to replicate different parts of itself to produce more copies, and then makes the cell burst open or lyse. The lysogenic process is essentially the same, however, the viral information remains dormant in the cell until the cell replicates (which replicates both the host and viral information, effectively leaving the new cell infected). After this occurs, the virus undergoes the same processes as the lytic cycle, ending with lysis of the cell.
2. This relates very closely to the COVID-19 pandemic that we were all a part of for 2 years. It shows how difficult it is to fight off viruses, since something like COVID, which is lysogenic, can remain dormant for a long time, essentially creating a catastrophic scenario inside the body, since many cells are infected at once, and more will get infected after the lysis of those infected cells. I have never experienced COVID, however, both my parents have caught it, and they both experienced chest pains - which was most likely due to the fact that their lungs were sore from coughing so much, as well as the lysis of cells infected by the virus. 
3. I find it pretty insane that viruses can specialize just like cells, since they can only infect cells which have the specific receptor protein they have. This is why you don't feel leg pain when you have a respiratory virus, but get muscle weakness and joint pain when you have a virus that infects the brain stem - like Zika virus.
