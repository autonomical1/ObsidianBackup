# Homeostasis Lab - Homeostasis and Exercise

## Procedure:
- 1. Find your pulse in your neck or your wrist. Make sure you can feel it, and then mark that location with a small dot using a pen or marker. 
- 2. Using the stopwatch and without doing any exercise, time 30 seconds and count the number of times your heart beats. Then, multiply this by two and record on the data table. 
- 3. Then, do 5 jumping jacks, wait 10 seconds, do 5 more jumping jacks, wait another 10 seconds, then do 5 jumping jacks. 
- 4. Find your pulse, and count the number of times your heart beats immediately after your last jumping jack within 30 seconds, multiply by two, and record. 
- 5. Rest for 1 minute.
- 6. Repeat step 4 two more times.

## Data:

|   |   |   |   
|---|---|---|
|   |Rest (BPM)|Set|
|Trial 1|70|114|
|Trial 2|69|118|
|Trial 3|74|124|

### Post-Lab Analysis
- 1. My heart rate increased during exercise, and then settled down once I took my rest.
- 2. I had to start breathing harder and faster since my heart was beating much faster, and I started feeling a little warm.
- 3. It took almost 1-1.5 minutes to return back to regular heart rate, which was expected, but still a lot more than I thought.

- **Homeostasis**: regulation of an organism's internal environment.
- All organ systems in an organism work together to maintain homeostasis.
	- Specific feedback loops between brain and body maintain set points of the body
	- Body reacts to stimulus --> Brain communicates how to counteract stimulus
	- 3 parts to feedback loop: receptor, control center, and effector
	- ![[Pasted image 20230623012819.jpg]]
		- Receptor gathers info from inside and outside organism.
		- Control center (brain) gathers information and compares the information to ideal conditions. If any information is off of the set point of the organism's ideal conditions, the control center will send a message to the effector.
			- organs, tissues, systems
			- will change activity in response to needs of organism
- **Hypothalamus**: controls thermoregulation

1. Homeostasis is the process of the constant changing of bodily features like temperature, pH, or other conditions to ensure that everything works correctly.

## Homeostasis in Animals
- Specific organ systems work together to maintain homeostasis
- Ex. regulation of blood pH through relationship b/w circulatory and respiratory systems
	- circulatory - brings O<sub>2</sub> to tissues and exch. waste/gasses. respiratory system expels gas wase and brings in new oxygen
- Ex: osmotic balance

## Homeostasis in Plants
- plants can regulate water content
	- through the use of *stomata* - pores on underside of leaves that regulate water and gasses
		- surrounded by guard cells - open or close based on amount of water within plant cell
- also regulate water content through the *xylem* - found throughout root and shoot systems of plant

## Feedback Loops
- Negative feedback loop:
	- control center reverses current condition of body either higher or lower than set point and return body to normal state
		- blood sugar/temp
		- ![[Pasted image 20230623171233.jpg]]
- Positive feedback loop
	- increase change from set point
	- ex: childbirth - contractions stimulate hypothalamus and oxytocin causes more contractions
