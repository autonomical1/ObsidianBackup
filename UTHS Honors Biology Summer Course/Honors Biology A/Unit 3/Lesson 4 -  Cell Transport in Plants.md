- No leaves: Stem becomes red
- One leaf: stem and leaf get red
- Four Leaves: stem and leaves get red

### Root Hairs
- Picture:
	- ![[RenderedI (17).jpg|240]]
- Description: a long stalk with cells, hairs on outer sides
- Function: increase surface area of exchange between roots and soil, take in water and nutrients

### Stomata Mag
- Picture:
	- ![[RenderedI (14).jpg|250]]
- Description: valve like cell that opens and closes
- Function: regulates gas exchange between plant and environment, also regulates control water loss

### Root Mag
- Picture:
	- ![[RenderedI (15).jpg|240]]
- Description: cells with central core
- Function: absorbs water and minerals and transport them to stems

### Stem Mag
- Picture:
	- ![[RenderedI (16).jpg|250]]
- Description: green cells with central core, larger cells in center
- Function: transfer water and nutrients to leaves

### Leaf
- Picture:
	- ![[RenderedI (18).jpg|240]]
- Description: layered flat slab
- Function: change sunlight into energy through photosynthesis

- 3 basic parts of a plant: *roots, stems, leaves*
	- each contain *xylem* and *phloem*
	- allow them to complete photosynthesis efficiently and effectively
	- Xylem carries water and dissolved minerals from roots to the stems to the leaves of a plant
	- Phloem carries sugar and starches made during photosynthesis from one part of the plant to another.
	- Xylem cells are hollow and dead
- Root hairs, epidermis, and stomata all are specialized cells that maintain homeostasis and provide transport
	- roots absorb water through root hairs, xylem transports water to leaves
	- transpiration and polarity of water transport water to leaves
		- **transpiration pull**
	- epidermis - tissue that covers entire plant body, keeps moisture in the plant body
	- cuticle - waxy covering of the epidermal layer, protects epidermis from water loss
	- Stomata - found on underside of leaves, regulate water and gases
		- surrounded by guard cells - either open or close based on amount of water in plant cell.
		- regulation is important to photosynthesis

1. Roots, stems, leaves
2. Xylem - dead, hollow cells that move water and nutrients; Phloem - living cells that move sugar and starches to parts of plant

|Specialized Plant Cell Types|Location|Function|
|Root hairs|on the root of the plant|increase surface area of the root to gain water|
|Epidermis|outer walls on entire plant|keep moisture in plant body|
|Stomata|underside of leaves|regulate water and gas content of plant|
