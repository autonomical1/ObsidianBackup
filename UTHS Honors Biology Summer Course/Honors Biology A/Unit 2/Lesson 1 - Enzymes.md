1. The enzyme and substrate come into contact.
2. The substrate splits into 2 parts.
3. The substrate attaches to the enzyme.
4. The enzyme begins to break down the substrate.

- Enzymes are proteins.
	- Most basic level of protein: primary structure - order of amino acids.
	- Secondary Structure: hydrogen bonds cause chain to spiral/bend
	- Tertiary Structure: whole chain, including secondary structure, folds up on itself.
	- Quaternary Structure: 2 amino acid chains fold up and fit together like a puzzle.
- speed up chemical reactions by building molecules/breaking them down.
- a.k.a **catalyst**
- build and break specific molecules because of complex structure. 
- *active site* allows enzymes to bind to specific molecules (substrates)
	- this recognition for specific substrates and enzymes lowers activation energy which speeds up reaction

1. Enzymes remind me of the cut out part of a puzzle piece.
2. Substrates are the molecules that fit into enzymes.
3. The substrate is the insert part of a puzzle piece, and the enzyme is the puzzle piece with the cut out part.
4. Enzymes decrease the activation energy of a certain reaction, and its function is denotated by the shape of the protein.

## Table of common enzymes and their functions:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Enzyme|Function|
|Lactase|Breaks down lactose|
|Sucrase|Breaks down starches and sugars|
|Maltase|Breaks down sugars|
|Catalase|Breaks down hydrogen peroxide|
|Primase|Builds RNA sequences|
|Ligase|Connects nucleotides|

1. The names of the enzymes all end in -ase. They also have names of the things they break down at the start of their names.

3. **Sucrase** - If the sucrase enzyme in a cell was not functioning properly, the cell would not be able to break down starches and sugars necessary to produce usable energy for the body.
