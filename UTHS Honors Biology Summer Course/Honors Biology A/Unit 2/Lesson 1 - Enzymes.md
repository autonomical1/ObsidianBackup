1. The enzyme and substrate come into contact.
2. The substrate splits into 2 parts.
3. The substrate attaches to the enzyme.
4. The enzyme begins to break down the substrate.

- Enzymes are proteins.
	- Most basic level of protein: primary structure - order of amino acids.
	- Secondary Structure: hydrogen bonds cause chain to spiral/bend
	- Tertiary Structure: whole chain, including secondary structure, folds up on itself.
	- Quaternary Structure: 2 amino acid chains fold up and fit together like a puzzle.
- speed up chemical reactions by building molecules/breaking them down.
- a.k.a **catalyst**
- build and break specific molecules because of complex structure. 
- *active site* allows enzymes to bind to specific molecules (substrates)
	- this recognition for specific substrates and enzymes lowers activation energy which speeds up reaction

1. Enzymes remind me of the cut out part of a puzzle piece.
2. Substrates are the molecules that fit into enzymes.
3. The substrate is the insert part of a puzzle piece, and the enzyme is the puzzle piece with the cut out part.
4. Enzymes decrease the activation energy of a certain reaction, and its function is denotated by the shape of the protein.

## Table of common enzymes and their functions:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Enzyme|Function|
|Lactase|Breaks down lactose|
|Sucrase|Breaks down starches and sugars|
|Maltase|Breaks down sugars|
|Catalase|Breaks down hydrogen peroxide|
|Primase|Builds RNA sequences|
|Ligase|Connects nucleotides|

1. The names of the enzymes all end in -ase. They also have names of the things they break down at the start of their names.
2. ![[RenderedI.jpg]]
3. **Sucrase** - If the sucrase enzyme in a cell was not functioning properly, the cell would not be able to break down starches and sugars necessary to produce usable energy for the body.


# Enzymes Lab

### Pre-lab Questions
- 1. Quaternary protein structure is necessary for enzyme function, because it creates larger complexity, therefore "programming" the enzyme for that specific substrate.
- 2. Heating an enzyme will decrease its activation energy, since the energy that it already requires is added. 
- 3. High pH will cause the reaction to go much slower, and low pH will cause the reaction to move faster, since there is already acid present to break down molecules.
- 4. The enzyme will not be as effective at low temperatures, because the activation energy for the reaction will be much larger, since it will require more energy to reach it.

### pH Test Procedure
- Put 2 mL of hydrogen peroxide in 3 test tubes.
- Mix 4 mL of liver juice with 4 mL of lemon juice in a separate test tube. 
- Repeat with 4 mL of distilled water, and 4 mL of bleach. 
- Mix the liver and lemon juice test tube with one of the hydrogen peroxide test tubes and record the speed of the reaction.
- Repeat with the distilled water/liver juice test tube and bleach/liver juice test tube.
- Wash the test tubes after completion.

### Post-Lab Questions
- 1. Since the structure of the enzyme determines which molecules react with it, the function of the enzyme is entirely dependent on what it is made or programmed to do.
- 2. Temperature, pH, and concentration of enzyme all can affect the function of an enzyme. 
- 3. The reaction rate decreased drastically as the temperature increased.
- 4. There were bubbles of oxygen gas that formed as the reaction occured.
- 5. The enzyme catalase was present, since there were bubbles of oxygen gas that were formed as the reaction occurred.
- 6.
