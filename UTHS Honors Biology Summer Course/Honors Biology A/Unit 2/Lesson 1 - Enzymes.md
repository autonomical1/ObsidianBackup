1. The enzyme and substrate come into contact.
2. The substrate splits into 2 parts.
3. The substrate attaches to the enzyme.
4. The enzyme begins to break down the substrate.

- Enzymes are proteins.
	- Most basic level of protein: primary structure - order of amino acids.
	- Secondary Structure: hydrogen bonds cause chain to spiral/bend
	- Tertiary Structure: whole chain, including secondary structure, folds up on itself.
	- Quaternary Structure: 2 amino acid chains fold up and fit together like a puzzle.
- speed up chemical reactions by building molecules/breaking them down.
- a.k.a **catalyst**
- build and break specific molecules because of complex structure. 
- *active site* allows enzymes to bind to specific molecules (substrates)
