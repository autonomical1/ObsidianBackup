|Bacteria*|The microscopic high-tech wizardry of bacteria|cylinder with long tail-like strings on all sides|human body is estimated to have more bacteria cells than human cells|
|Plant**|generic green plant cells under a microscope|hexagon shaped cells with small organelles|contain a chloroplast that does photosynthesis - produces its own energy from the sun|
|Animal**|Animal cells microscopic view|blob-like shape, bright red dot - nucleus|smaller than plant cells|
* * Prokaryote 
- ** Eukaryotic

- Cells discovered by *Robert Hooke*
- **Cell Theory**:
	- All living things are made of cells.
	- Cells are the basic unit of life.
	- Cells are formed from other living cells.

1. Cells were first identified by Robert Hooke, who looked at a magnified image of cork, and saw small room-like areas - which he recognized as cells.
2. Leeuwenhoek created a better microscope.
3. All living things are made of cells, cells are the basic unit of life, cells are formed from other cells.
4. Light microscopes and electron microscopes.

- Prokaryote:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230620231834.jpg]]
	- Do not contain any membrane-bound organelles
	- Smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells
	- only exist as bacteria
	- protected by plasma membrane, contain DNA
- Eukaryote:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230620231944.jpg]]
	- Larger, contain **organelles**
