## Unit 3, Lesson 3 (HON BIO A)
1. This lesson is about how cell transport works in animal cells. There are 5 different specialized cells that animals have that facilitate transport. In blood cells, the structure of the cell allows for it to hold onto oxygen from the lungs and deliver it throughout the body via a protein called hemoglobin. In smooth muscle cells, the cell uses cell transport to get nutrients, which allows it to function very well, therefore allowing it to contract muscle. Skeletal muscle cells are responsible for practically every movement that is voluntary in the body. Cardiac muscles do the same, but for the heart. Epithelial cells are meant to protect deep tissues from any intruders, and it will take in and release certain materials via their cell membranes to make that happen. All of these interactions occur because of the interactions with hypertonic, isotonic, and hypotonic solutions, all which change the way water or materials move between the cell and its environment.
2. Since all humans are animals, and animals in general are all around us, this lesson gives a very in-depth insight on how the body works, and what is best for hydration and other things. We know that salty things make us thirstier, which is obvious based on experience, but now, it provides us with a scientific reasoning behind that. It is also important to understand how it works, because it shows us how cells in general work, which is important to understanding how life works.
3. I found it quite interesting that there were three different types of muscle cells, all with their own functions and forms of transport and looks. I also found it interesting that the concentration of the surrounding liquid near a cell can change how it acts, take out water, and even cause the cell to lyse, which is honestly scary in the big-picture. I do wonder: is the reason our skin gets wrinkly in water because of the tonicity of the surrounding water?
