- Energy originates from the sun.
- Plants use sun's energy to create food by storing potential energy in biomolecules.
	- **autotrophs**: organisms that can create their own food
- **heterotrophs**: must consume organic matter to receive the chemicals needed to power the body
- **glucose**: most important biomolecule to store potential energy
	- stores a very large amount of energy - so much that it must be broken down to *adenosine triphosphate* or **ATP**. 
		- this is usable energy for cells

- Organisms convert the energy from the sun between multiple forms from the sun.
- Interconnectedness of organisms is seen through food webs/chains
	- show hierarchies between predator and prey
- Organisms that can perform photosynthesis/chemosynthesis(creating food from chemicals) are autotrophs. (a.k.a. producers). 
- Producers live at the lowest level of a food pyramid - each level is a *trophic level*
