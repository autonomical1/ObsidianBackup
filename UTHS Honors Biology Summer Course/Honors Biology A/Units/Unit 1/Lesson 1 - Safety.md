1. Hold the test tube using tongs or another tool that allows you to keep the test tube away from your body.
2. If the test tube breaks, call the teacher and have them assess what to do.
3. Wash your skin and eyes in the emergency shower and eye wash for at least 15 minutes.

1. I was doing a lab in my Honors Chemistry class which required me to wear goggles and gloves, since we were working with Copper Sulfate which was toxic to ingest and be in contact with. We also had to wear closed-toed shoes and long pants, as well as long-sleeved shirts.

3. In the case of a splash or broken glass, the goggles and protective clothing would have kept the chemicals or glass away from skin.
4. I would have called my teacher over, and started washing myself in case I got chemicals on myself.
