- All living organisms use nutrients to live, grow, reproduce, and maintain homeostasis.
- via cellular respiration, nutrients to ATP
- animals must obtain nutrients via consumption of other organisms
- digestive system converts protein, fat, and complex carbs into their monomers for use in cells
- fungi decompose and digest organic matter outside of bodies using enzymes and then absorb needed nutrients for survival.
- **extracellular digestion**: food is broken down outside cells in a digestive system, then absorbed by cells to be used.
- process begins in mouth with intake of food,
	- teeth break down food into smaller particles. 
	- enzymes in saliva also help chemically break down food
	- food is then swallowed and enters esophagus, which is a long tube that connects mouth to stomach via peristalsis
	- stomach acids have very low pH, which breaks down tissues and kills microorganisms
