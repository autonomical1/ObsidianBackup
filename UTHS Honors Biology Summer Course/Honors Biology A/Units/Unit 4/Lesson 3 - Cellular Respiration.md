1.  Human emissions like burning of fossil fuels, 

- In cellular respiration, chemical energy stored in glucose($C_6H_{12}O_6$) is converted with the help of oxygen into carbon dioxide, water, and ATP. 
- Balanced Equation: $$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6 H_2O + \text{ ATP}$$
- all living things use ATP to power cellular processes.
	- 3 phosphates connected by chemical bonds store energy
	- when phosphate removed from ATP, it becomes ADP, then releases energy
	- can be regenerated by adding a phosphate to ADP
	- done using cellular respiration
- 2 forms of respiration: *anaerobic and aerobic respiration*
	- anaerobic does not require oxygen, aerobic does.

## Glycolysis
- First step in breaking down glucose
- produces 2 molecules known as **pyruvate**
- in prokaryotes, glycolysis occurs in cytoplasm.
	- this means that it is a form of **anaerobic respiration**
- doesn't produce as much energy as other stages of respiration.
- at the end, 2 molecules of **pyruvate**, **1 three-carbon molecule**, **and 2 ATP molecules** are produced per glucose molecule consumed.
- pyruvate created in glycolysis is further used in mitochondria for more energy production.

## The Krebs Cycle and the Electron Transport Chain
- occur in the mitochondria
- **produce most of the ATP organisms need to survive**
- produce **34 ATP molecules** + **2 ATP molecules from glycolysis**
- since eukaryotes are the only cells with mitochondria, these 2 processes are specific to eukaryotic cells.
- pyruvate created in glycolysis enters mitochondria and undergoes series of reactions that require oxygen - therefore making it **aerobic**
- CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> are also produced in these processes. CO<sub>2</sub> is a waste product to humans which is removed. 

## Fermentation
- Pyruvate created in glycolysis can also be further broken down when oxygen is unavailable (anaerobic)
- Two types:
	- *lactic acid fermentation*: lactic acid is a byproduct, occurs when oxygen is scarce
		- heavy exercise means that cells will undergo LAF to gain as much energy as possible - this causes the soreness after muscle workouts
	- *alcohol fermentation*: alcohol is byproduct
		- can be done by yeast

1. Glycolysis: This is the first step in the process of breaking down glucose. This forms 2 molecules of pyruvate, which are high-energy molecules that are later broken down to make more glucose; The Krebs Cycle and Electron Transport Chain: This process creates the bulk of the ATP that the cell requires. This is done in the mitochondria.

# Bobbing Leaves Lab

1. Hypotheses:
	1. In the control trial, if there is no source of carbon dioxide in the solution, the leaf disk will remain floating.
	2. In trial 1, if there is both a source of carbon dioxide and a source of light, photosynthesis will occur, causing the leaf disks to sink.
	3. In trial 2, if there is a source of carbon dioxide, but no source of light, photosynthesis will not occur, which means that the leaf disks will remain floating.
2. Oxygen is produced during photosynthesis, and it is used as a product in cellular respiration.
3. The mitochondria and chloroplasts are the sites of cellular respiration and photosynthesis.

#### Graph: Number of leaves afloat vs. Time
![[RenderedI (22).jpg]]

My hypothesis for the control was partially correct since most of the leaves stayed afloat, however, I think one of them sank since there could have been contamination.
My hypothesis for trial 1 was also correct since most of the leaves sank. My hypothesis for trial 2 was partially correct, but there could have been some light leakage.

Photosynthesis would produce oxygen gas and glucose within the cells. As the cells produce oxygen, the process of cellular respiration occurs, which uses that oxygen to create ATP and CO<sub>2</sub> gas. Trial 1 was the fastest rate since there was presence of both carbon dioxide and light energy. Trial 2 was the slowest since there was no light but CO<sub>2</sub> was present. 

This experiment could be improved by making the area that has trial 2 is fully covered from light, and the control and trial 1 are closer to a light source.
