# Specialized Cells Lab- Plant Structures

|    |    |
|---|---|
|Plant Tissue|Function|
|Epidermis|Covers and protects all parts of plant|
|Cortex|Involved in transporting water and minerals into vascular tissue|
|Xylem|dead cells that transport water and minerals throughout plant|
|Phloem|transport sugars throughout plant|

### Post-Lab Questions
1. There are phloem and xylem cells in the roots.
2. They increase the surface area of the root, which allows it to intake more water.
3. There would be many special cells, but there would surely be epidermis cells on all sides, with cortex and phloem cells in the middle to transport water to the leaves of the plant.

- To perform life processes to survive, cells in any multicellular organism will specialize.
- Have a specific shape to perform specific function
- Collections of specialized cells - **tissue**
- **Organs**: collection of tissues that work together to perform a similar function
- **Organ System**: collection of organs that interact to perform specialized processes

1. Cells - Tissues - Organs - Organ System - Organism
2. Bacteria are single-celled, so all life processes are done by that one cell. Plants and animals have many cells that can specialize to work on specific processes.

4. This cell will have a lot of mitochondria.
5. It will have smaller amounts of ribosomes.
