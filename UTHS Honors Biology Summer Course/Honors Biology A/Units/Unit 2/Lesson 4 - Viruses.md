- infect host cell by attaching to receptor proteins - similar to substrates and enzymes
- virus attaches to surface protein b/c it has a complementary protein.
- Since structure of cells varies since they are specialized, viruses can only infect certain cells - *host specificity*

|Type of Virus|Cell(s) Infected|Symptoms of Infection|Treatment|Type of Reproduction<br><br>(Lytic or Lysogenic)|
|Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)|White blood cells - CD4|Fever, muscle pains, sore throat, diarrhea|No cure, medications can control it|lytic|
|Influenza (Flu)|respiratory epithelial cells|fever, sore throat, cough, runny nose, headaches, fatigue|rest, fluid intake, anti-inflammatory pain relievers can help|lytic|
|Zika|neural stem, progenitor cells|fever, rash, headache, joint pain, red eyes|no specific treatment; get rest, drink fluids, treat symptoms|lysogenic|
|COVID-19|cells along the airways by attaching to ACE-2 cell receptor|fevers, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue|OTC medications (tylenol/ibuprofen) |lysogenic|

### Venn Diagram

- Virus: 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230623001833.jpg]]

- Microscopic, non-living particles
- Composed of protein and nucleic acids - DNA/RNA
- outside coat - **capsid**, contains DNA and RNA, allows virus to disguise itself as it invades cells. 
- Invasion of host cell is necessary for viral reproduction
- take over cell to make copies
- Types of viral reproduction:
	- **Lytic Cycle**: (occurs in bacteria, plant, and animal cells)
		- 1. Attachment: attach to receptor proteins on cell membrane on host cell
		- 2. Entry: injection of DNA/RNA into host cell
		- 3. Replication: New virus parts made by host cell
		- 4. Assembly: Viral parts combine to make new viruses.
		- 5. Lysis and Release: Host cell lyses (bursts open) and viruses escape.
		- ![[Pasted image 20230623002556.jpg]]
	- **Lysogenic Cycle**: (occurs in animal cells only)
		- Attach to cell and inject genetic material
		- Viral info remains dormant for long periods of time; as cell divides, it will make copies of both host and viral genetics, so new cells get infected.

## Smallpox Video Questions
1. How does the smallpox virus spread from person to person? **Through the air**
2. What cell types are hosts to the smallpox virus? **attacking skin cells, spleen, and bone marrow**
3. What are the symptoms of a smallpox infection? **skin lesions all over the body**
4. How did variolation evolve? **Doctors would take scar material from infected people and insert it into healthy people by the 1700s. -- Inoculation** 
5. How did Edward Jenner discover vaccines? **He discovered vaccines because of a statement that a dairy maid made about cowpox** 
6. How does variolation differ from vaccination? **Used actual smallpox virus instead of a close variation of smallpox which was less dangerous.** 
7. Why do vaccinated people not get infected? **The body gains immunity against the less dangerous version of the virus.**
