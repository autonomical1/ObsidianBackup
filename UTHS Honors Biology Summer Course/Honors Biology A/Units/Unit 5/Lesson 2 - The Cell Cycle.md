# Modeling DNA Replication Lab

### Reflection Questions
1. The M&M represents the nitrogenous base.
2. Gummy worms can represent the phosphate backbone, and gummy bears can represent the deoxyribose sugars.
3. I could use Pixy stick powder to represent the hydrogen bond between the two bases.
4. The two DNA molecules were the same, except the positions of each strand were flipped.
5. I first set up the initial strand, then created its complementary strand using the base pairing rules. Then, I moved the complementary strand over to the side and copied the initial strand over exactly, and did the same with the initial strand.

### DNA Replication
- DNA replication begins with one DNA molecule with two strands, and ends with two exact copies. 
- Each nucleotide composed of phosphate backbone, sugar, and nitrogen base. 
- Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, and Guanine are the 4 nucleotides.
- 4 main steps of DNA replication:
	- Step 1: Unzip
		- DNA unwinds from its double helix structure. 
		- **Helicase*** unzips DNA by breaking H-bond between base pairs. 
	- Step 2: Prep
		- When H-bonds are broken, DNA strands separate, and nucleotides exposed
		- ***primase*** adds short RNA sequence as primer for new DNA strand - DNA polymerase can't start w/o primer
	- Step 3: Grip
		- ***DNA Polymerase*** (enzyme) adds new nucleotides to exposed parent strand to form new base pairs. Primer disintegrates after polymerase adds nucleotides.
		- also proofreads nucleotides for mistakes
	- Step 4: Re-zip
		- As DNA polymerase adds base pairs, ***ligase*** follows by "re-zipping" DNA molecules by forming H-bonds between base pairs. 
- DNA replication is ***SEMI-CONSERVATIVE***
	- 1 new daughter strand + 1 parent strand

- Cell cycle is split into two main phases: interphase and mitosis


### Interphase
- DNA replication occurs during the S phase of interphase
- Interphase is the period between cell division where cell grows and matures. 
- 3 distinct phases: 
	- G1: cells grow and increase in size; synthesize new proteins and organelles to better suit their specialized function
	- S: (synthesis of new DNA); cell prepares for division; At the end, cell has 2x DNA
	- G2: cell begins to produce organelles and molecules necessary for mitosis

### Mitosis
- Cell enters M phase (mitosis) where cell divides into two daughter cells.
- IPMAT: Interphase, Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase
	- phases of cell cycle
- ![[Pasted image 20230708195915.jpg]]
- 1st Phase: Prophase
	- replicated DNA condense into duplicated chromosomes and centrioles move to opposite poles. nuclear membrane begins to disintegrate and centrioles begin to make spindle fibers.
- 2nd Phase: Metaphase
	- duplicated chromosomes line up in middle of cell
	- spindle fibers attached are called **centromeres** which connect two sister *chromatids*
		- condensed DNA strand in duplicated chromosome
	- ![[Pasted image 20230708200131.jpg|200]]
- 3rd Phase: Anaphase
	- chromosomes are pulled apart and move toward opposite ends of cell
- 4th Phase: Telophase
	- Last phase, not final step
	- nuclear membrane begins to reform and condensed chromosomes begin to untangle.
	- cell pinches in the middle.
- **Cytokinesis**: completely divides cell into two cells - each contain identical set of DNA
