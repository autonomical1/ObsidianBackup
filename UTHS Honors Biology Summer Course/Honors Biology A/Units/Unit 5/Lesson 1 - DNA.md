- DNA is genetic information passed down from parent to offspring
- as parent cell divides into two daughter cells, genetic material passed on is identical
- nucleic acid
- located in nucleus of eukaryotes, and free-floating in prokaryotes
- polymer of nucleotides:
	- 3 components: deoxyribose sugar (no oxygen), phosphate, and nitrogenous base
- hydrophilic
- 4 types of nitrogenous bases; create base pair from complementary nucleotides by forming H bonds - **Adenine (A)** pairs with **Thymine (T)** and **Cytosine (C)** pairs with **Guanine (G)**
- DNA becomes double helix
	- ![[Pasted image 20230706005216.png]]
- directs protein synthesis and cell division as well as cell specialization in multicellular organisms.
- Then, gets replicated and passed onto offspring in cell cycle

- I admit this looks much worse than what you have as an example, but I could not find anything that would work well with the stuff I had - no tape or hot glue.
- The spoons represent the bases. There are bent skewers on the top, which kind of represent the sugar and phosphate backbone (obviously not as well).
