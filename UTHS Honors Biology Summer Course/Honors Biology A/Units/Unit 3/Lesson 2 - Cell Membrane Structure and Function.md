1. Cell membrane looks like a border crossing, in the sense that it has 2 entry points and it is regulated.
2. It allows for the regulation of things to enter and leave the cell.
3. A cell membrane allows the cell to control what goes in and comes out.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Potato|Initial (g)|Final (g)|% change in mass|
|A|20|21|5%|
|B|15|14|-7%|

### Post-Lab Analysis
1. ![[709497905.jpg|400]]
2. No. This is because the cells will release or take in water until the cells and the surrounding water are at equal concentration, which was already attained.
# Outer Cell Boundaries: Cell Membrane/Wall
- all cells have cell membrane - has 3/4 biomolecules - proteins, lipids, and carbs
	- all form structural membrane with specific functions

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Component|Structure|Function|
|Phospholipid|Phosphates and Lipids, where phosphate is the head and lipid is the tail|Create the membrane of the cell, which selectively allows certain molecules to pass through|
|Peripheral proteins|protein|come in contact with only inside and outside cell - allow for the movement of molecules in and out of cell|
|Channel proteins|protein|move certain materials into and out of cell|
|Integral membrane proteins|protein|allow movement of materials within and out of cell|
|Glycoproteins|carbohydrate and protein|protection and cell communication|
|Glycolipids|lipid and carbohydrate|provide energy and cellular recognition|
|Cytoskeleton|protein|support and cellular movement|
|Cholesterol|lipid|fluidity of membrane|

# Phospholipid Bilayer
- 2 layers composed of phosphates and lipids
- tails point toward each other and phosphate heads point toward outside and inside cell.
- tails are nonpolar (hydrophobic) and heads are hydrophilic
- ![[Pasted image 20230624011040.jpg|300]]

# Membrane Proteins
- Proteins either partially/fully embedded in PB
- Some proteins (peripheral) come in contact with only inside or outside cell; others (integral membrane proteins and protein channels) move certain materials within cell.
- Proteins composed of carb and protein (**glycoprotein**) function for protection and cell communication
- **Glycolipids**: lipid+carb
	- energy, cell recognition
- **Cytoskeletal filaments**
	- support and cellular movement
- **Cholesterol**
	- fluidity of membrane

# Cell Wall
- Cells of *plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protists* protected and supported by cell wall
- outside plasma membrane, does not determine material movement of cell.
- made of *polysaccharide cellulose*
- 3 distinct parts: **primary, secondary wall, and lamella*

# Passive Cellular Transport

## Diffusion
- molecules move constantly with kinetic energy.
- If concentration of molecules are high in a given area, they will move around more and collide more frequently.
- ![[Pasted image 20230626135412.jpg]]
	- As they collide, spread out evenly in its space
- In cell transport, movement of molecules from *high to low concentration* is **diffusion**
- **passive transport**: doesn't require energy
	- molecules move across **concentration gradient**: difference in concentration of molecules in a space
	- Mass, extent of concentration gradient, and temperature can all affect rate of diffusion

1. Diffusion is the movement of small particles travelling across a difference in concentration, with the ultimate goal of reaching equilibrium.
2. ![[RenderedI (6).jpg|400]]
3. The mass of the molecules and temperature can affect diffusion since there is a change in kinetic energy of each molecule. 

## Osmosis
- diffusion of water across a semi-permeable membrane
- move from *high to low*
	- ex: concentration of water outside cell > concentration inside cell = water moves both ways
		- more water into cell
- **form of passive transport**
- direction of movement depends on amount of solute inside cell compared to outside
- 3 types of solutions:
	- **Hypertonic**: higher concentration of dissolved substances than a solution to which it is being compared
	- **Isotonic**: identical concentration of solute than the other solution
	- **Hypotonic**: lower concentration of solute than the other solution

1. Osmosis is important to the cell because it allows it to regulate its water content, and the movement of water is important to cell functions.
2. Hypertonic solutions have a higher concentration than isotonic solutions.
3. It does not require energy, since the molecules all move from a high to low concentration.

## Facilitated Diffusion
- Cell membrane is *selectively permeable*
- if a molecule is too large to pass through membrane, it requires help through the form of facilitated diffusion
- form of **passive transport**
- carrier proteins allow larger molecules to move through the cell membrane quickly
- ![[Pasted image 20230626142029.jpg|250]]

1. Facilitated diffusion requires a protein to assist the movement of large molecules across the cell membrane, compared to regular diffusion, with small molecules.
2. Since carrier proteins allow for a larger channel across the membrane, larger molecules can move across it.

## Active Transport
- Moving molecules against concentration gradient is important to achieve homeostasis
- certain amino acids and ions are moved via active transport
- Ex: Na-P pump:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230626142300.jpg|300]]
- Can also occur via **vesicles**: small packages of materials enclosed by a membrane
	- *endocytosis*: process of transporting substances into a cell via vesicle
		- occurs in 2 ways depending on the size of particles being transported
			- *pinocytosis*: small particles entering the cell via vesicle
				- cell membrane indents, particle enters indentation, piece of membrane surrounds and encompasses particle.
			- *phagocytosis*: large molecules enter cell via vesicle
				- portion of cell membrane wraps around particle, once food is surrounded, membrane joins together, encloses food particle in vesicle, then food is digested by special enzymes.
			- *exocytosis*: opposite process of phagocytosis to excrete waste


1. ![[RenderedI (7).jpg]]
2. Phagocytosis is the process of moving large particles across the cell membrane. The particle approaches the cell membrane, the cell membrane wraps around the particle, encompasses it, closes behind it, and takes it inside the cell using a vesicle.
3. Pino and phagocytosis require energy since the cell membrane is moving around.
