- can occur either sexually or asexually
	- self-pollination/cross-pollination
- cross-pollination - pollen grains which contain male gamete transferred from one plant to another via **pollinators** - wind/water/bees/birds/etc.
- self-pollination - pollen grain in plant fertilizes egg cell in the same individual
	- still sexual reproduction since genetic material exchanged are unique

### Plant reproductive systems
- similar to male and female reproductive structures


### "Male" Reproductive Structures
- primary role of creating and delivering male gamete
- male gamete = pollen
- reproductive structure: **stamen**
	- two parts
		- **anther**: pollen producing structure
		- **filament**: holds up anther, long, enables anther to be held up high

### "Female" Reproductive Structures
- create female gamete
- provide place for fertilized egg cell to develop new offspring
- seeds released from plant and can grow into new, mature plant
- reproductive structure: **pistil**
	- **stigma**: top of pistil, sticky pad for pollen grains to stick to
	- **style**: long tube in midsection of pistil, holds up stigma and provides connection between top and bottom of pistil
	- **ovary**: bottom of pistil, contains female gametes awaiting fertilization
	- **ovules**: develop into seeds if fertilized
- petals surround stamen and pistil to attract pollinators
- sepal: green, budlike structure that surrounds developing bud and offers protection to developing seeds
- pollen tube: when pollen grain lands on stigma, secretes enzyme that creates pollen tube, small tunnel creates path for pollen grain to make its way into ovary
