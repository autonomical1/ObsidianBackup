# 17.1 - What is Light
- Has property of both waves and particles
- 3 models:
	- Wave model: wave optics
	- Ray model: light travels in a straight line
		- ray optics
	- Photon models: photons have both wave-like and photon-like particles. photons = quanta of light

### The Propagation of Light Waves
- A water wave passes through a window-like opening in a barrier.
- Wave spreads out to fill the space behind the opening. **Diffraction**
	- clear sign that the wave is passing through the opening
- When the opening is many times larger than the wavelength of the wave, the wave continues to move straight forward
- This is similar to the straight-line appearance of light with sharp shadows as light passes through large windows.
### Light is an Electromagnetic Wave
- All EM waves move at the speed of light: $c = 3.00 \cdot 10^8$ 
- $$f = \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{3.00 \cdot 10^{8}}{600 \cdot 10^9}$$
### Index of Refraction
- Speed of light in a material is characterized by the material's **index of refraction**$$n = \frac{\text{speed of light in a vacuum}}{\text{speed of light in the material}} = \frac{c}{v}$$
	- n is always greater than 1 because v is always less than C, vacuum has n = 1.
- **The frequency of a wave does not change as the wave moves from one medium to another.**
- **The wavelength in the transparent material is shorter than the wavelength in a vacuum.**

# 17.2 - The Interference of Light
- Because light acts as a wave, light waves can overlap and interfere constructively and destructively
- Young's Double-Slit Experiment
	- To observe interference, 2 light sources need to overlap and interfere
	- For experiment: light shown through 2 slits, light passing through the slits impinge on the viewing screen.
	- light spreads out behind each slit
	- constructive interference at the point where distance $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$ are a whole wavelength apart
	- Constructive interference when $\Delta r = m \lambda$, where $m = 0,1,2,3, ...$ 
		- bright fringes occur at these point
	- path-length interference = $$\Delta r = d \sin \theta$$
