**Measuring Current**:
- Ammeter: 
	- Schematic symbol: -(A)-
	- Ideal: 0 $\ohm$
	- Connected in series
**Measuring Voltage**:
- Voltmeter:
	- Symbol: -(V)-
	- Ideal: $\infty$ resistance
	- Connected in parallel

**Capacitors in Parallel or Series**:
- parallel capacitors can be represented by a single **equivalent capacitance**
- Total charge on two capacitors in a parallel circuit: $$Q = Q_{1} + Q_{2} = C_{1} \Delta V_{c} + C_{2} \Delta V_{c} = (C_{1} + C_{2}) \Delta V_{c}$$
- Potential differences across 2 capacitors in series are: $$\Delta V_{1} = \frac{Q}{C_{1}}$$ and $$\Delta V_{2} = \frac{Q}{C_{2}}$$
- Total potential difference:
