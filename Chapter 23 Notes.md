**Measuring Current**:
- Ammeter: 
	- Schematic symbol: -(A)-
	- Ideal: 0 $\ohm$
	- Connected in series
**Measuring Voltage**:
- Voltmeter:
	- Symbol: -(V)-
	- Ideal: $\infty$ resistance
	- Connected in parallel

**Capacitors in Parallel or Series**:
- parallel capacitors can be represented by a single **equivalent capacitance**
- Total charge on two capacitors in a parallel circuit: $$Q = Q_{1} + Q_{2} = C_{1} \Delta V_{c} + C_{2} \Delta V_{c} = (C_{1} + C_{2}) \Delta V_{c}$$
- Potential differences across 2 capacitors in series are: $$\Delta V_{1} = \frac{Q}{C_{1}}$$ and $$\Delta V_{2} = \frac{Q}{C_{2}}$$
- Total potential difference: $$\Delta V_{c} = \Delta V_{1} + \Delta V_{2}$$
- Total Capactiance in a series circuit is:$$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_{1}} + \frac{1}{C_{2}}$$

**RC Circuits**:
- RC Circuits are circuits containing resistors and capacitors
- current varies with time
- values of resistance and capacitance in RC circuits determines the time it takes to charge/discharge
- At a later time in the circuit's lifespan, the current will decrease because the potential difference is decreasing
- The current and capacitor voltage decay to zero after the switch closes, but not linearly

**Charging a Capacitor**:
- In a circuit that charges a capacitor, once the switch is closed, the potential difference of the battery causes a current int he circuit, and the capacitor begins to charge.
- As the capacitor charges, it develops a potential difference that opposes the current, so the current decreases, and so does the rate of charging
- The capacitor charges until $\Delta V_{c} = \epsilon$
