[[6.1 -  Gravitation is a force of universal importance; add circular motion and you start explaning the motion of planets]]

[[6.2 - An object moving in a circle is acceleration even if its speed is constant]]

[[6.3 - For an object in uniform circular motion, the net force exerted on the object points toward the center of the circle]]

[[6.4 - Newton's law of universal gravitation explains the orbit of the Moon, and introduces us to the concept of field]]
