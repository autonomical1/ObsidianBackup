- **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: rotational analog of conservation of linear momentum
	- Similar to the principle of conservation of linear momentum where an object or system can set another object into rotational motion
	- angular momentum is always conserved
- An object's linear momentum is (m)(v), whereas a rotating object's angular momentum depends on its rotation axis (for a rotating extended object, it also depends on its shape)
