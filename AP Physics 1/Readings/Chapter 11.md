- **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: rotational analog of conservation of linear momentum
	- Similar to the principle of conservation of linear momentum where an object or system can set another object into rotational motion
	- angular momentum is always conserved
- An object's linear momentum is (m)(v), whereas a rotating object's angular momentum depends on its rotation axis (for a rotating extended object, it also depends on its shape)

# 11-2
- **Angular Momentum**: the product of the moment of inertia of the rotating object and the angular velocity along the rotation axis
	- L<sub>z</sub> = Iω<sub>z</sub>
	- L is directly proportional to both moment of inertia and angular velocity
	- If there is no Στ on a system, the L of the system is constant
## Angular Momentum of an Object
- Objects with linear momentum can also have angular momentum where angular momentum is the radius of the object multiplied by the linear momentum of the object
	- L = rp = rp sin Θ = r(mv) sin Θ
		- p = linear momentum
		- r = radius
