- **Mechanical Energy**: energy related to motion
- energy is conserved in any system
- energy transferred into or out of a sustem (when the system is not closed and isolated) can change the ΔK, ΔU<sub>g</sub>, or ΔE<sub>internal</sub>
- For an isolated, closed system, conservation of energy means total energy stays constant, since no energy can enter or exit the system
- If the only interactions inside a closed, isolated system are conservative, the system's ΔE is constant

- K<sub>i</sub> + U<sub>i</sub> = K<sub>f</sub> + U<sub>f</sub>
- ΔK + ΔU = 0
	- 	change in potential energy and change in kinetic energy must equal 0 in a closed system
- total mech. energy is a property of a system, not a single object
- total energy - sum of kinetic, potential, and internal energies (always conserved)
- for an open system, energy transfers into/out of a system are equal to the change in energy of a system
- if the only interactions in a closed, isolated system are conservative, then the total mechanical energy E of the system is constant. The values of K and U change, but K + U is constant
- if nonconservative interations occur inside a closed, isolatio
