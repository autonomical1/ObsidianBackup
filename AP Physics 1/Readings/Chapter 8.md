- **Mechanical Energy**: energy related to motion
- energy is conserved in any system
- energy transferred into or out of a sustem (when the system is not closed and isolated) can change the ΔK, ΔU<sub>g</sub>, or ΔE<sub>internal</sub>
- For an isolated, closed system, conservation of energy means total energy stays constant, since no energy can enter or exit the system
- If the only interactions inside a closed, isolated system are conservative, the system's Δ
