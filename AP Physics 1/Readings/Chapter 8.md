- **Mechanical Energy**: energy related to motion
- energy is conserved in any system
- energy transferred into or out of a sustem (when the system is not closed and isolated) can change the ΔK, ΔU<sub>g</sub>, or ΔE<sub>internal</sub>
- For an isolated, closed system, conservation of energy means total energy stays constant, since no energy can enter or exit the system
- If the only interactions inside a closed, isolated system are conservative, the system's ΔE is constant
# 8-2
- K<sub>i</sub> + U<sub>i</sub> = K<sub>f</sub> + U<sub>f</sub>
- ΔK + ΔU = 0
	- 	change in potential energy and change in kinetic energy must equal 0 in a closed system
- total mech. energy is a property of a system, not a single object
- total energy - sum of kinetic, potential, and internal energies (always conserved)
- for an open system, energy transfers into/out of a system are equal to the change in energy of a system
- if the only interactions in a closed, isolated system are conservative, then the total mechanical energy E of the system is constant. The values of K and U change, but K + U is constant
- if nonconservative interactions occur inside a closed, isolated system, the total mechanical energy of the system changes. the change in total mechanical energy is qual and opposite to the change in internal energy since the total energy of a closed, isolated system is constant.

- the kinds of problems that are best solved using the law of conservation of energy are the ones which an object moves from one place to another under an unbalanced force
- law of conservation of energy simplifies solving problems bc energy is a scalar quantity
- drawing a diagram is essential to show which forces work on the object
# 8-4
- power is the amount of energy transferred from one object or system to another, or converted from one type to another per unit of time
	- P = W
- power delivered to an object is related to the speed of the object and the magnitude and direction of the force exerted on the object that is doing the work causing the energy transfer
	- P = Fv
