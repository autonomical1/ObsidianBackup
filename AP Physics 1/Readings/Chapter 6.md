- Space flight has its origin in Newton's **law of universal gravitation**: all objects in the universe attract each other through the force of gravity
- Gravitational forces are partly responsible for holding Earth together.

# 6.2
- **uniform circular motion**: when an object goes moves in circular motion at a constant speed
- **centripetal acceleration**: center seeking; acceleration is pointed towards the middle of the circular motion
## Analyzing Motion in a circle
- (delta)(theta) = (delta)s / r
- if the time interval between points 1 and 2 is short, theta is small
- nonuniform circular motion works well with a(cent) =  v^2 / r

# 6.3
- centripetal acc. depends on the radius of the curve and the speed
- any kind of force provides the acceleration in circular motion

# 6.4
