- Space flight has its origin in Newton's **law of universal gravitation**: all objects in the universe attract each other through the force of gravity
- Gravitational forces are partly responsible for holding Earth together.

# 6-2
- **uniform circular motion**: when an object goes moves in circular motion at a constant speed
- **centripetal acceleration**: center seeking; acceleration is pointed towards the middle of the circular motion
#### Analyzing Motion in a circle
- (delta)(theta) = (delta)s / r
- if the time interval between points 1 and 2 is short, theta is small
- nonuniform circular motion works well with a(cent) =  v^2 / r

# 6-3
- centripetal acc. depends on the radius of the curve and the speed
- any kind of force provides the acceleration in circular motion

# 6-4
- Newton knew that the Moon orbits the Earth at near constant speed

#### Law of Universal Gravitation
- g = (a constant) / r^2
- this goes to:
	- G*M1<M2 / r^2
- also could be known as "the inverse-square law of gravitation"

#### Finding the Value of G and the Mass of the Earth
- G * M(earth) * m(you) / r^2(earth)
- **Cavendish Experiment**: gravitational force of the large sphere on the small sphere makes the wooden rod rotate

## Fields are a useful way to model fundamental forces
- **fields**: associate a value of some physical quantity to every point in space

# 6.5

## Circular Orbits: Orbital Speed and Orbital Period
- easiest orbit to analyze is circular orbit
- 2(pi)r (sqrt)r/G(m)(earth)

# 6.6
- **apparent weightlessness**: no normal force
	- there is still a gravitational force so they can't be weightless
