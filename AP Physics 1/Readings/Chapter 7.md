- **conservation**: when energy is transferred between objects/systems, or converted from one type to another, but is not created or destroyed
	- amount of total energy is unchanged within a system
- **conservation law**: statement that a measurable physical quantity of a system does not change as the system evolves over time. 
- **energy**: defined as a scalar quantity used to measure the state or motion of an object or system
	- all energy is conserved, but quantities are not always equal
- closed systems are often used to limit the factors that can affect the results of a specific problem or experiment
- open system can exchange both energy and matter
- **closed, isolated systems**: no energy or matter is transferred to, or from the system, and there are no interactions b/w objects in the system or outside the system
- **law of conservation of energy**: energy can be converted from one type or another, but can not be created or destroyed
- **work**: transfer of energy
