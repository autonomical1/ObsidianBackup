- **conservation**: when energy is transferred between objects/systems, or converted from one type to another, but is not created or destroyed
	- amount of total energy is unchanged within a system
- **conservation law**: statement that a measurable physical quantity of a system does not change as the system evolves over time. 
- **energy**: defined as a scalar quantity used to measure the state or motion of an object or system
	- all energy is conserved, but quantities are not always equal
- closed systems are often used to limit the factors that can affect the results of a specific problem or experiment
- open system can exchange both energy and matter
- **closed, isolated systems**: no energy or matter is transferred to, or from the system, and there are no interactions b/w objects in the system or outside the system
- **law of conservation of energy**: energy can be converted from one type or another, but can not be created or destroyed
- **work**: transfer of energy from one object or system to another through a mechanical process that happens when a force is exerted on an object or system
- **kinetic energy**: energy that an object has due to its motion
- **potential energy**: energy associated with a reversible change in shape
	- rubber ball
- **internal energy**: energy stored within a system, sometimes in a way that can't be easily extracted

- W = F<sub>app</sub>d
	- W = work done on an object by a constant force *F<sub>app</sub>* 
	- F<sub>app</sub> = magnitude of **CONSTANT** force F
	- d = magnitude of displacement
- unit for work is the **joule**
	- 1 J = 1 N * 1 M

#### Muscles and Doing Work
- no work is done on an object when its displacement is 0

#### Work by Forces Not Parallel to Displacement, and Negative Work
- W = Fd * cos θ
	- W = work done on an object by a force F that points at an angle θ to the object's displacement *d*
	- F = Magnitude of force *F*
	- d = Magnitude of displacement *d*
	- cos θ = angle between directions of *F* and *d* 
- negative work: transferring energy out of the object
	- ex.: lifting a pen is doing positive work, lowering a pen does negative work

#### Calculating Work done by multiple forces
- *total work*: sum of work done by all forces
- **Tension Force**: W<sub>tension</sub> = *F*<sub>T</sub>d cos θ<sub>T</sub>
- **Gravitational Force**: since cos 90° = 0, W<sub>gravity</sub> = 0
- **Normal Force**: since cos 90° = 0, W<sub>N</sub> = 0
- **Kinetic Friction Force**: W<sub>friction</sub> = F<sub>k</sub>d cos 180° = -F<sub>k</sub>d

- there is a general relationship between ΔW and Δv
- v<sub>fx</sub><sup>2</sup> = v<sub>ix</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2a<sub>x</sub>(Δx)
	- v<sub>fx</sub><sup>2</sup> = x<sub>f</sub> because v<sub>fx</sub> is equal to +v<sub>f</sub>
