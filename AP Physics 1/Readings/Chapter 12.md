- Oscillation is a kind of motion in which an object moves back and forth around an equilibrium position
# 12-2
- Oscillation is caused by the interplay between 1) a restoring force that returns an object to its equilibrium position (where it experiences 0 net force) and 2) inertia that makes the object overshoot equilibrium
- The period of an oscillation is the time for one complete cycle. The frequency, which is the reciprocal of the period, is the number of cycles per second
- The amplitude of an oscillation equals the magnitude of the maximum displacement from equilibrium
