# 5-1
- external forces determine the magnitude and direction of the object's acceleration
- force of friction plays an important role in many physical situations
	- this is a special type of force
	- always opposes motion

# 5-2
- resists sliding of one object past another
- **static friction force**: when a force is applied to make an object slide, but it doesn't move
- **kinetic friction force**: when an object is moving
- result from microscopic irregularities in the surface
- **macroscopic**: physical objects are measurable and can be seen by the unaided eye
- friction results from electrostatic interactions
	- these are a fundamental force - repulsion between electrons

#### Properties of Static Friction
- Fₛ is the notation for static friction
	- parallel to the surfaces in contact
- Fₛ,ₘₐₓ is the notation for the max amount of static friction. To overcome this, Fₐₚₚ must be greater than Fₛ,ₘₐₓ
- Fₙ (normal force) is perpendicular to the surface


#### Measuring the Coefficient of Static Friction
- sum of the external forces on the block in each direction should be equal to the mass * acceleration
-  Fₛ,ₘₐₓ = µₛFₙ
	- Fₛ,ₘₐₓ - the maximum force of static friction depends on...
	- µₛ - the coefficient of static friction (which depends on the properties of the two surfaces in contact) …
		- described by an inequality
		- direction is parallel to the contact surface
	- Fₙ - and the normal force pressing the object against a surface

# 5-3
#### Magnitude of the Kinetic Friction Force
- Fₖ -  force of kinetic friction
	- proportional to how hard 2 surfaces are pushed together
	- modeled as being independent of how fast the 2 objects slide past each other as well as independent of the area of contact b/w the objects
- µₖ -  **coefficient of kinetic friction**
	- depends on the kinds of surfaces in contact

#### Rolling Friction
- always opposes the motion of a rolling object
- Fᵣ = µᵣFₙ
- Coefficient of rolling friction can be a very small number

# 5-4
- First, draw a free-body diagram for each obj. of interest
- Then, use the FBD to write a N2L equation for each obj. of interest
- Take into account the kinetic and static friction forces
