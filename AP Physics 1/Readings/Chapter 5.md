# 5-1
- external forces determine the magnitude and direction of the object's acceleration
- force of friction plays an important role in many physical situations
	- this is a special type of force
	- always opposes motion

# 5-2
- resists sliding of one object past another
- **static friction force**: when a force is applied to make an object slide, but it doesn't move
- **kinetic friction force**: when an object is moving
- result from microscopic irregularities in the surface
- **macroscopic**: physical objects are measurable and can be seen by the unaided eye
- friction results from electrostatic interactions
