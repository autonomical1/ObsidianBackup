- When 2 objects interact with each other, they can be modeled using **momentum**
	- vector
- **Law of Conservation of Momentum**: P<sub>f</sub> = P<sub>i</sub>
- The idea of momentum is useful in situations where 2+ objects interact with each other
# 9.2
- ΣF = ma can be used to model how velocities can change
- p = mv
	- **Linear momentum** of an object
	- proportional to objects velocity and mass
- Linear momentum of an object or system is a vector
- If 2 obj/sys at rest push away from each other, each acquires an equal amount of momentum in opp. directions (if no other ΣFs applied)
- If 2 obj of different masses have the same magnitude of momentum, the object with the smaller mass has more KE than the larger
- Collisions are short, strong interactions between 2 objects or systems
