- When 2 objects interact with each other, they can be modeled using **momentum**
	- vector
- **Law of Conservation of Momentum**: P<sub>f</sub> = P<sub>i</sub>
- The idea of momentum is useful in situations where 2+ objects interact with each other
# 9.2
- ΣF = ma can be used to model how velocities can change
- p = mv
	- **Linear momentum** of an object
	- proportional to objects velocity and mass
- Linear momentum of an object or system is a vector
- If 2 obj/sys at rest push away from each other, each acquires an equal amount of momentum in opp. directions (if no other ΣFs applied)
- If 2 obj of different masses have the same magnitude of momentum, the object with the smaller mass has more KE than the larger
- Collisions are short, strong interactions between 2 objects or systems
# 9.3
- **Total Momentum**: momentum of a system of objects, just after the action

#### System of several objects : internal and external forces
- the object model will fit well before and after a collison, not during collision itself
- 2 kinds of forces can be exerted, internal and external
- ΣF<sub>a</sub> + ΣF<sub>b</sub> = m<sub>a</sub>a<sub>a</sub> + m<sub>b</sub>a<sub>b</sub>
- ΣFΔt = Δp<sub>total</sub>
	- ***IMPULSE MOMENTUM THEOREM***
- In a system of objects, internal forces are forces that one object in the system exerts on another object in the system. External forces are forces exerted on objects in the system by other outside forces
- if ΣF<sub>ext</sub> = 0, p<sub>total</sub> = constant
# 9.4
- **elastic collision**: internal forces inside a system are conservative
	- both total momentum and mechanical energy are constant
#### COMPLETELY INELASTIC
- m<sub>a</sub>v<sub>ai</sub> = (m<sub>a</sub> + m<sub>b</sub>)V<sub>f</sub>
