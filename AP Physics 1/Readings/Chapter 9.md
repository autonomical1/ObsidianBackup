# 9.1
- When 2 objects interact with each other, they can be modeled using **momentum**
	- vector
- **Law of Conservation of Momentum**: P<sub>f</sub> = P<sub>i</sub>
- The idea of momentum is useful in situations where 2+ objects interact with each other
# 9.2
- ΣF = ma can be used to model how velocities can change
- p = mv
	- **Linear momentum** of an object
	- proportional to objects velocity and mass
- Linear momentum of an object or system is a vector
- If 2 obj/sys at rest push away from each other, each acquires an equal amount of momentum in opp. directions (if no other ΣFs applied)
- If 2 obj of different masses have the same magnitude of momentum, the object with the smaller mass has more KE than the larger
- Collisions are short, strong interactions between 2 objects or systems
# 9.3
- **Total Momentum**: momentum of a system of objects, just after the action

#### System of several objects : internal and external forces
- the object model will fit well before and after a collison, not during collision itself
- 2 kinds of forces can be exerted, internal and external
- ΣF<sub>a</sub> + ΣF<sub>b</sub> = m<sub>a</sub>a<sub>a</sub> + m<sub>b</sub>a<sub>b</sub>
- ΣFΔt = Δp<sub>total</sub>
	- ***IMPULSE MOMENTUM THEOREM***
- In a system of objects, internal forces are forces that one object in the system exerts on another object in the system. External forces are forces exerted on objects in the system by other outside forces
- if ΣF<sub>ext</sub> = 0, p<sub>total</sub> = constant
# 9.4
- **elastic collision**: internal forces inside a system are conservative
	- both total momentum and mechanical energy are constant
#### COMPLETELY INELASTIC
- m<sub>a</sub>v<sub>ai</sub> = (m<sub>a</sub> + m<sub>b</sub>)V<sub>f</sub>
#### Special Cases of Completely Inelastic
- Moving object has much greater mass than the object at rest
	- M<sub>a</sub> + M<sub>b</sub> can be replaced with M<sub>a</sub>
- both objects have the same mass
	- V<sub>f</sub> = V<sub>ai</sub>/2
- moving object has much less mass than the object at rest
	- V<sub>f</sub> = 0
- in an elastic collision the forces between the colliding objects are conservative. Both momentum and mechanical energy are constant in an inelastic collision.
- An inelastic collision is one in which there are nonconservative forces between the colliding objects so that some of the initial kinetic energy is turned directly into internal energy. 
- In a completely inelastic collision the colliding object sticks together. momentum is constant, but the maximum amount of kinetic energy possible is converted to internal energy
- final kinetic energy in a completely inelastic collision is the minimum kinetic energy required to conserve momentum for any type of collision that system may undergo
# 9.5
- a collision is elastic if kinetic energy is completely restored and linear momentum is constant
- if a moving object has a head on collision with the second, stationary object, how the objects move after collision depends on the ratio of masses between the two objects
# 9.6
- the change in momentum of an object during a collision equals the force exerted on the object during the collision multiplied by the contact time
	- the length of time that the object touches another during the collision
- the same change in momentum can be produced by a large force exerted for a short time or by a large force exerted for a longer time
# 9.7
- the center of mass for a system of objects is a weighted average at the positions of the individual objects
- the total momentum of the system equals the system's total mass multiplied by the velocity of the center of mass
- if there is a net external force on the system, the center of mass accelerates as though all of the
