- When 2 objects interact with each other, they can be modeled using **momentum**
	- vector
- **Law of Conservation of Momentum**: P<sub>f</sub> = P<sub>i</sub>
- The idea of momentum is useful in situations where 2+ objects interact with each other
# 9.2
- ΣF = ma can be used to model how velocities can change
- FΔt = mΔv
	- Impulse-Momentum Theorem
