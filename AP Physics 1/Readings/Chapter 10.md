- Translation refers to the motion of the CoM of a sys/obj from one point to another through space
- Rotation refers to the spinning motion of an ext. obj
- ext. object can rotate around a fixed axis (rotation without translation) or its or its axis can move as the extended object rotates (rotation with translation)

- Angular velocity is a measure of how rapidly and in what direction an extended object rotates. Angular speed is the magnitude of angular velocity.
- The speed of a point on a rotating extended object depends on the point's distance from the rotation axis and the extended object's angular speed
- the rotational inertia of a rigid body depends on the rigid body's mass and how that mass is distributed relative to the rigid body's rotation axis
- the rotational kinetic energy of a rigid body spinning around an axis depends on its angular speed and its rotational inertia for that axis

- since rotational inertia depends on shape, we can find exact equations of rotational inertia only for extended objects that do not change shape (rigid bodies)
- for other extended objects, these equations are only good while shape is not changing, or to qualitatively consider how change your shape will affect rotational inertia
- the rotational inertia of an extended object is additive and increases as the extended objects' masses move farther from the rotation axis
- the extended objects' rotational inertia depends on the axis around which the extended object rotates
- the parallel-axis theorem relates the rotational inertia for an axis through an extended object's center of mass to the rotational inertia for a second, parallel axis

- the rotational kinetic energy K of an extended object of mass M is the sum of the translational kinetic energy of its center of mass, K<sub>rotational</sub> = 1/2 * Mv<sup>2</sup> , and the rotational kinetic energy of the extended objects rotation around its center of mass. For a rigid body this rotational kinetic energy can be written K<sub>rotational</sub> = 1/2IÏ‰
- the same energy conservation equations for Conservation of Energy also apply when there is rotational motion. The only difference is that the kinetic energy K now includes both rotational and translational kinetic energies.
- if an extended object rolls without slipping on the surface, its speed of its center of mass is directly proportional to its angular speed. If the rolling extended object is perfectly rigid., a rigid body, and the surface over which it rolls is also rigid, less static friction force is present but does no work on the rigid body as it rolls.

- just as acceleration in a straight line is the rate of change of velocity, angular acceleration is the rate of change of angular velocity.
- If the angular acceleration is constant for a rigid body, there are three equations that relate time, angular position, angular velocity, and angular acceleration, that are of the same structure as the relationships among the linear quantities.

# 10-6
- If the force exerted on the extended object generates a torque, that torque changes that extended object's rotation. The magnitude of the torque depends on where the force is applied relative to the rotation axis and on the orientation of the force.
- The magnitude of a torque is equal to the magnitude of the force that causes the torque multiplied by the lever arm of the force (the perpendicular distance from the rotation axis to the line of action of the force).
- New in second law for rotation says that if a net external torque,
