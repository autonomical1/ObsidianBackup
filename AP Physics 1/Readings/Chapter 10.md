- Translation refers to the motion of the CoM of a sys/obj from one point to another through space
- Rotation refers to the spinning motion of an ext. obj
- ext. object can rotate around a fixed axis (rotation without translation) or its or its axis can move as the extended object rotates (rotation with translation)

- Angular velocity is a measure of how rapidly and in what direction an extended object rotates. Angular speed is the magnitude of angular velocity.
- The speed of a point on a rotating extended object depends on the point's distance from the rotation axis and the extended object's angular speed
- the rotational inertia of a rigid body depends on the rigid body's mass and how that mass is distributed relative to the rigid body's rotation axis
- the rotational kinetic energy of a rigid body spinning around an axis depends on its angular speed and its rotational inertia for that axis

- since rotational inertia depends on shape, we can find exact equations of rotational inertia only for extended objects that do not change shape (rigid bodies)
- for other extended objects, these equations are only good while shape is not changing, or to qualitatively consider how change your shape will affect rotational inertia
- the rotational inertia of an extended object is additive and increases as the extended objects' masses move farther from the rotation axis
- the extended objects' rotational inertia depends on the axis around which the extended object rotates
- the parallel-axis theorem relates the rotational inertia for an axis through an extended object's center of mass to the rotational inertia for a second, parallel axis
