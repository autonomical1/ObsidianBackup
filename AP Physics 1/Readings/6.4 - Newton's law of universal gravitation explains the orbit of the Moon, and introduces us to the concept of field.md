- Newton knew that the Moon orbits the Earth at near constant speed

# Law of Universal Gravitation
- g = (a constant) / r^2
- this goes to:
	- G*M1*M2 / r^2
- also could be known as "the inverse-square law of gravitation"

# Finding the Value of G and the Mass of the Earth
- G * M(earth) * m(you) / r^2(earth)
- **Cavendish Experiment**: gravitational force of the large sphere on the small sphere makes the wooden rod rotate

# Fields are a useful way to model fundamental forces
- **fields**: associate a value of some physic
