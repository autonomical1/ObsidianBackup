**Batteries and emf**
- Capacitor quickly runs out of excess charge, but a wire connecting the battery terminals can keep the charges in motion
- The inner workings of a battery act like a charge escalator between the 2 terminals
- charges are removed from the negative terminal and "lifted" into the positive terminal
- Chemicals called *electrolytes* sandwiched between 2 electrodes of different material. chemicals react and move + ions from one electrode to another. 
- By separating charge, charge escalator est. $\Delta V$ between the terminals of a battery
- potential difference established by a device like a battery = emf
- emf also written as $\epsilon$
- rating of a battery, like 1.5 V = battery's emf
	- determined by the chemicals in the battery
	- battery with no current in it has a $\Delta V$ equal to its emf
