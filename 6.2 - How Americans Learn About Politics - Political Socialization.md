- **political socialization**: process through which an individual acquires his or her particular political orientations
	- as age increases, orientations grow firmer
	- governments aim socialization efforts largely at the young

# The Process of Political Socialization
- only a small portion of American political learning is formal
- informal learning of government is more important than formal learning because most of it is acquired by environment

#### The Family
- role in socialization is central because of the access it has to time and emotional commitment
- parents interest in politics => child's interest in politics
- children pick up their political orientations as a child
