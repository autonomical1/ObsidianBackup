1. A problem I would like to know the answer to is how far a car can go while the internal gas gauge shows 0 miles.
2. I think that the car can go about 15 miles before it will stop.
3. I can get a car that shows 0 miles on the range calculator, and drive on a track. I can then count the number of laps it can drive until it stops. Then, I can repeat this 2 more times and count the number of laps it takes to stop every time and average it to see the average number of miles it can drive while showing zero inside the car.
