- **Nomination**: party's official endorsement of a candidate for office
- success req. $, media, attention, and momentum
- **Campaign Strategy**: way in which candidates attempt to manipulate these elements to receive nomination
- in most advanced industrialized countries, campaigning is only for 2-3 months by custom or law
	- in America, it can seem endless
# Competing for Delegates
- Nomination can be harder than actual general election
- goal is to get as many delegates as possible for the **National Party Convention**
	- supreme power w/in each part, which functions to formally select presidential and vice presidential candidates and write party platform
- early in 20th century, presidential primary was promoted by reformers who wanted to take nominations out of the hands of the party "bosses"
- **McGovern-Fraser Commission**: A commission formed at the 1968 Democratic convention in response to demands for reform by minority groups and others who sought better representation.
	- party leaders could not handpick the convention delegates in secret
- **super delegates**: people who are awarded auto slots as delegates based on their current office
	- being a member of Congress, party member of national committee
	- can overturn and be decisive in tight contests
	- reluctant to exercise that power however
#### Invisible Primary
- **invisible primary**: potential candidates work to build up crucial sources of support and form positive first impressions
-  try to create positive personal image in the media
- Personal quals, character, and intelligence are often more important because party members usually agree more than disagree
#### Caucuses and Primaries
- From Jan - June of election year, ind. state parties choose delegates to nat'l convention via caucuses/primaries
- Iowa is the first to get votes with caucus method
- **Caucus**: system for selecting convention delegates used in a dozen states in which voters must attend an open meeting to express their presidential preference
	- participation is lower due to time consumption
- since Iowa is first voting opportunity, it is a big media thing, so if problems occur, candidate image can be ruined
- most of the delegates in Dem/Rep nat'l conventions come from **presidential primaries**: state's voters go to polls to express pref. for a party nominee
	- begins in NH
	- benefits image of candidate
- **frontloading**: more states have been moving their primaries earlier to capitalize on media attention
	- pose 2 problems: 
		- rush to judgement due to delegates being chosen quickly
		- states that hold late primaries have proved to be irrelevant since candidate has already secured nomination
- State laws determine how delegates are allocated
	- operate w/in general guidelines set by parties
	- Dems. req. all states to use some form of proportional rep. in which a cand. who gets 15%+ of state vote is awarded roughly prop. share of delegates
	- Reps. use 3 basic forms:
		- allocate all Rep. delegates to whoever gets most votes
		- award based on who wins each Congressional district
		- proportional representation
		- adopted a rule banning winner-take-all primaries for most states
