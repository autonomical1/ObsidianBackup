# Accepting Cases
- Courts of original jurisdiction cannot easily reject a case
- appx. 8,000 cases sent a year, and must be read, culled, and sifted
- At least once a week, all justices meet in total secrecy about the cases.
	- if 4 justices agree to hold a review on a case (a.k.a *the rule of four*), it is taken to oral argument 
	- the lower court is sent a *writ of certiorari* which brings the case up from the inferior court
- Court is most likely to accept cases that involve major issues
	- esp. civil liberties
	- conflicts between lower courts on the interpretation of federal law
-  **Solicitor General**: in charge of the appellate court litigation of the federal government
	- presidential appt. and 3rd-ranking off. in DOJ
	- Staff and SG have 4 jobs:
		- 1. decide whether to appeal cases gov't has lost in lower courts
		- 2. review/modify briefs presented in gov't appeals
		- 3. rep. the gov't before the Supreme Court
		- 4. submit an *amicus curiae* brief on behalf of a litigant which the gov't is interested in but not involved
	- Recently, the Court has made 80 formal written decisions per year which could serve as precedent for later cases related to the same things
	- *per curiam decision* - decision without explanation
		- resolve the case imm. but have no value as precedent

# The Process of Decision Making
- the Court hears oral arguments in 2-wk cycles
	- 2 wks of courtroom, then 2 weeks of reflection and opinion writing
- Before the lawyers present their arguments, they have prep'd briefs and also may have recieved *amicus curiae* briefs from interested parties
- In most instances, the attorneys from each side have 30 min to brief the Court
- Back in the conference room, the chief justice, starts the discussion
- once a tentative vote has been reached, the Court writes an **opinion** - statement of legal reasoning behind the decision of the case
	- not just a formality, it also can (in content) be as important as the decision itself
	- Broad and bold opinions have created great precedent, and a narrow opinion doesn't provide a precedent
	- content of the opinion can win/lose votes
- At least 6 justices must participate in a case, and cases are decided by a majority vote
- If there is a tie, (judge doesn't vote/vacancy in the court), the lower courts' decision is considered

# The Basis of Decisions
- ***stare decisis***: "let the decision stand"; earlier decision must hold for the case
- **precedent**: the way similar cases were handled in the past as a guide to current decisions
- Constitution doesn't specify a way for justices to interpret it
- **originalism**: a view that the Constitution can be interpreted according to the original intentions or original meaning by the Framers. Many Conservatives support this
	- Takes 2 principal forms:
		- *original intent theory*: interpretation of a written law should be consistent with what was meant by those who drafted and ratified it.
			- supported by Clarence Thomas
		- *original meaning theory*: judges should base interpretations on what reasonable persons living at the time would believe the original meaning to be 
	- meant to constrain and limit judicial discretion which is viewed as the foundation of liberal Court decisions
- When the Founders wrote the Constitution, they embraced very general principles which lacked discrete, discoverable meaning
- some scholars proposed a model where justices decide cases based largely on the outcomes they prefer instead of precedent
# Implementing Court Decisions
- Court conveys decisions through formal announcement in open court
- Media coverage remains primitive - short, shallow, to the point
- Court decisions carry legal, even moral, authority, but courts must rely on other units of gov't to enforce their decisions
- **Judicial Implementation**: how/whether court decisions are translated into actual policy
- Judicial decision (litigation) ends, and judicial implementation begins
- As believed by Charles Johnson and Bradley Canon, implementation of court involves:
	- *interpreting population*: composed of lawyers and judges
		- must correctly understand and reflect the intent of the original decision in their subsequent action
	- *implementing population*: the agencies, companies, etc. that implement policy influenced by the Court's decisions
