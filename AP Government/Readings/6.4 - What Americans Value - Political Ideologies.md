- **political ideology**: coherent set of beliefs about politics, public policy, and public purpose, which helps give meaning to political events

# Who are the Liberals and Conservatives?
- recently, more people identify as conservative over liberal
- people under 30 are more likely to be liberal
	- younger people are statistically less likely to vote, thus overrepresenting the conservative vote
- excluded groups have gone to the government to rectify the inequalities of minorities
- many minority leaders place a high priority on social welfare and affirmative action programs
- Women are not a minority group but they are politically and economically disadvantaged
	- this leads to them being comparatively more liberal
	- **gender gap**: ideological differences between men and women (women vote more Democratic)
		- gender gap is a new predictor of ideological standpoints
- another source of ideological predictions are financial status/social class
