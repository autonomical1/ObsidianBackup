- **political ideology**: coherent set of beliefs about politics, public policy, and public purpose, which helps give meaning to political events

# Who are the Liberals and Conservatives?
- recently, more people identify as conservative over liberal
- people under 30 are more likely to be liberal
	- younger people are statistically less likely to vote, thus overrepresenting the conservative vote
- excluded groups have gone to the government to rectify the inequalities of minorities
- many minority leaders place a high priority on social welfare and affirmative action programs
- Women are not a minority group but they are politically and economically disadvantaged
	- this leads to them being comparatively more liberal
	- **gender gap**: ideological differences between men and women (women vote more Democratic)
		- gender gap is a new predictor of ideological standpoints
- another source of ideological predictions are financial status/social class
- role of religion in influencing political ideology also has changed 
	- Catholics and Jews have been more liberal than Protestants
	- Jews are the far most liberal demographic group in the country
	- ideological gap between Catholics and Protestants has shrunk smaller than the gender gap

# Do People Think in Ideological Terms?
- *The American Voter* was the first publication to examine how people use ideology to vote
	- Only 12 % of people thought in ideological terms, called *ideologues* (connect their opinions and beliefs with broad policy position taken by parties and candidates)
	- 42 % were classified as *group benefits* voters: think of politics in terms of groups they liked or disliked
	- 24% were *nature of the times* voters: handle on politics limited to whether times seemed good or bad
		- may link party in power with the times
	- 22 % were *no issue content* voters: people who don't have an ideological orientation
