# The Era of Slavery
- most Black people lived in slavery for the first 250 years of American settlement
	- property of their masters
	- could be bought and sold
	- could neither vote or own property
- Southern states were the primary market for slaves
- **Scott v. Sandford**: SCOTUS decision (1857) ruling that a slave that escaped to a free state had no rights as a citizen and that Congress could not ban slavery in those territories
- **13th Amendment**: constitutional amendment that abolished slavery and involuntary servitude

# The Era of Reconstruction and Segregation
- After Civil War, Congress imposed conditions on the former Confederate states before they could seat their representatives in the government
	- No one who served in the war or in the Confederate army could hold office
	- Legislatures had to ratify the new coming amendments
	- Military would govern the states like "conquered provinces" until they complied with these conditions
	- Many Black people served federal and state offices during the 10 years after the war
	- Rutherford Hayes promised to pull troops out of the south to win the election
		- Southerners imposed *Jim Crow Laws* which relegated Black people to segregate many important features of society
		- Most of these laws were common in both the North and Southern states
	- SCOTUS was also of little help
		- Decisions held that Black people couldn't serve on juries. 
		- found that 14th Amendment did not prohibit racial discrimination by private businesses and individuals
	- **Plessy v. Ferguson**: An 1896 Supreme Court decision that provided a constitutional justification for segregation by ruling that a Louisiana law requiring “equal but separate accommodations for the white and colored races” was constitutional.


# Equal Education
- **Brown v. Board of Education**: The 1954 Supreme Court decision holding that school segregation was inherently unconstitutional because it violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of equal protection. This case marked the end of legal segregation in the United States.
		- A year after, SCOTUS ordered lower courts to apply desegregation to schools
	- Not all racial segregation is what is called de jure (“by law”) segregation.
	- Majorities of both whites and blacks have opposed busing, which is one of the least popular remedies for discrimination

# The Civil Rights Movement and Public Policy
- civil rights movement organized both African Americans and whites, and using tactics such as sit-ins, marches, and civil disobedience, sought to establish equal opportunities in the political and economic sectors and to end the policies and practices of segregation
- By the 1970s, overwhelming majorities of white Americans supported racial integration.
- **The Civil Rights Act of 1964**: most important civil rights law in nearly a century. 
	- Made racial discrimination illegal in hotels, motels, restaurants, and other places of public accommodation 
	- Forbade discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, or gender
