- campaigns have 3 effects: reinforcement, activation, and conversion
	- mostly reinforce and activate, rarely convert
- weakening factors of campaigns:
	- most ppl pay less attention to campaigns
		- **selective perception**: paying most attention to things they already agree with and interpreting events based on their own predispositions
	- long-term factors - party identification, infl. voter behavior
	- incumbents start with substantial advantage in terms of name recognition
- some voters are persuadable because they disagree with their candidate on one major issue
- a good campaign that targets specific constituencies for persuasion makes the difference b/w winning and losing
- vote/how to vote
