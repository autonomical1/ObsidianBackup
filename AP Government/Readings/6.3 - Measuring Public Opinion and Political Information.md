# How Polls are Conducted
- Political polling developed by George Gallup
- Gallup is a word used for an opinion poll
- inefficient and expensive to ask everyone for opinion, so a **sample** (small proportion of people) is selected to represent the whole
- **random sampling**: principle that everyone should have an equal probability to be selected for the sample
	- key to the accuracy of polling
- **sampling error**: level of confidence that poll represents the beliefs of the public
	- the more people interviewed, the more confident the results
- accurate representation is the most important feature of a public opinion survey, not number of responses
- high-tech polling is cheaper now
- **random-digit dialing**: technique used by pollsters to place calls randomly to both listed and unlisted numbers when conducting a survey
	- reached at a cost 1/5th of person-to-person interviews
	- more difficult to get interviews on cell phones than landlines

# The Role of Polls in American Democracy
- help political candidates detect public preferences
- policymakers can keep in touch with public opinion
- if poll results move, policymakers can make changes that better suit people's wants
- critics of polling find that it makes politicians more interested in following than leading
- political leaders track public opinion so they can craft public presentations and win public support
- polls can weaken democracy by causing a *bandwagon effect*: distort election process by having people support candidates because others are.
- **exit poll**: public opinion surveys used by major media pollsters to predict electoral winners with speed and precision
- wording of questions can be altered to produce different results

# What Polls Reveal about Americans' Political Information
- level of public knowledge about politics is low
	- more for young people but for most people as well
- When trouble flares in a far-off country, polls regularly fi nd that people have no idea where that country is
- increasing level of education has scarcely raised public knowledge about politics
- Others will rely on simple information regarding which groups are for and against a proposal
