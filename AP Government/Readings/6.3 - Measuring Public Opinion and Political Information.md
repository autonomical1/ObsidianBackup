# How Polls are Conducted
- Political polling developed by George Gallup
- Gallup is a word used for an opinion poll
- inefficient and expensive to ask everyone for opinion, so a **sample** (small proportion of people) is selected to represent the whole
- **random sampling**: principle that everyone should have an equal probability to be selected for the sample
	- key to the accuracy of polling
- **sampling error**: level of confidence that poll represents the beliefs of the public
	- the more people interviewed, the more confident the results
- accurate representation is the most important feature of a public opinion survey, not number of responses
- high-tech polling is cheaper now
- **random-digit dialing**: technique used by pollsters to place calls randomly to both listed and unlisted numbers when conducting a survey
	- reached at a cost 1/5th of person-to-person interviews
