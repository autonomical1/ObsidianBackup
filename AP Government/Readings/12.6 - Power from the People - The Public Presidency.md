# Going Public
- Presidents are not passive followers of public opinion
- Presidents want to shape public opinion and make them look better

# Presidential Approval
- WH aims much of its energy to public approval to raise the President's public approval
- Presidents frequently don't have widespread public support
- Presidential Approval comes from many factors
	- party identification 
- Presidents usually benefit from a "honeymoon" period
	- the short grace period where public support is at a high
- Changes appear when public's evaluation of president's handling of policy changes
- Sometimes approval takes sudden jumps
	- based on things like rally events 
- The criteria on which the public evaluates presidents—such as the way they are handling the economy, where they stand on complex issues, and whether they are “strong” leaders—are open to many interpretations

# Policy Support
- "bully pulpit": presidents can persuade or even mobilize the public to support their policies if they are skilled communicators
- presidential speeches designed to lead public opinion have typically been rather unimpressive
- public is not always receptive to the president’s message
- Citizens also have predispositions about public policy (however ill informed) that filter presidential messages.

# Mobilizing the Public
- Sometimes merely changing public opinion is not sufficient—the president wants the public to communicate its views directly to Congress.
- Mobilization of the public may be the ultimate weapon in the president’s arsenal of resources with which to influence Congress.
