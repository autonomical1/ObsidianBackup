# Presidents try to control the bureaucracy
- presidents try to impose their policy standards on agencies.
- Tactics: 
	- _**Appoint the right people to head the agency**_: putting their own ppl into government positions is a good way to influence policy
	- _**Issue Orders**_: can issue **executive orders** ()
