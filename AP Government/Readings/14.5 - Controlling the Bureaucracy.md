### Alter an agency's budget
- the OMB is the own authority on any agency's budget. Cuts to the budget can bring the President to the agencies attention

### Reorganize an agency
- President Reagan tried to abolish Energy and Education, but couldn't succeed because they were backed by elements in Congress and strong constituent groups
