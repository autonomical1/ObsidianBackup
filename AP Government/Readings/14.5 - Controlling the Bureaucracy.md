# Presidents try to control the bureaucracy
- presidents try to impose their policy standards on agencies.
- Tactics: 
	- _**Appoint the right people to head the agency**_: putting their own ppl into government positions is a good way to influence policy
	- _**Issue Orders**_: can issue **executive orders** (regulations originating with the executive branch) used to implement statues, treaties, etc. rhetoric in speeches also can influence the bureaucracy
	- _**Alter an agency's budget**_: the OMB is the own authority on any agency's budget. Cuts to the budget can bring the President to the agencies attention
	- ***Reorganize an agency***: President Reagan tried to abolish Energy and Education, but couldn't succeed because they were backed by elements in Congress and strong constituent groups
