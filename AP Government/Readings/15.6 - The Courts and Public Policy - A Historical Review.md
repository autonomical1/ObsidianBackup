---------------------------------------------------------

- Confronted with controversial policies, the Courts must make controversial decisions

- After Civil War to ~1937, questions about relationship between federal government economy predominated
- From 1938 to now, questions about personal liberty and social and political equality have predominated

# John Marshall and the Growth of Judicial Review
- **Marbury v. Madison** The 1803 case in which Chief Justice John Marshall and his associates first asserted the right of the Supreme Court to determine the meaning of the U.S. Constitution. The decision established the Court’s power of judicial review over acts of Congress, in this case the Judiciary Act of 1789.
- **Judicial Review**: power of the courts to hold acts of Congress and, by implication, the executive in violation of the Constitution

Judicial review was established by John Marshall and his associates in Marbury v. Madison. Congress objected and never passed the plan. It became irrelevant, however, when two justices, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes and Associate Justice Owen Roberts, began switching their votes in favor of New Deal legislation.
