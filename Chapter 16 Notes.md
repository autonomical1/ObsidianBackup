### The Wave Model
- The **wave model** describes the basic properties of waves and emphasizes those aspects of wave behaviors common to all waves.
- **travelling wave** is an organized disturbance that travels with a well-defined wave speed

### Mechanical Waves
- **Mechanical Waves**: involve motion of the substance through which they move. Substance = medium
- **Disturbance**: wave that passes through a medium, displacing the atoms that make up the medium from their equilibrium position
	- travels with a **wave speed**
	- wave transfers energy, but **medium as a whole does not travel**
- **Waves transfer energy, but it does not transfer any material or substance outward from the source.**

### Electromagnetic and Matter Waves
- **Electromagnetic waves**: waves of an *electromagnetic field*. Includes visible light, radio waves, microwaves, etc.
	- req. no material medium and can travel through a vacuum.
- **Matter waves:** wave-like characteristics of material particles such as electrons and atoms

### Transverse and Longitudinal Waves
- **transverse**: wave in which the particles in the medium move perpendicularly to the direction in which the waves travels. 
- **longitudinal**: particles in the medium move parallel to the direction in which the wave travels.
	- sound waves are the most common form of longitudinal waves.
- earthquake waves: S waves (transverse) and P waves (longitudinal)

# 16.2 - Travelling Waves
### Wave Speed is a Property of the Medium
- **The wave speed does not depend on the size and shape of the pulse, how the pulse was generated, or how far it has traveled.**
- speed depends on mass-to-length ratio, the **linear density** of the string
	- $$\mu = \frac{m}{L}$$
- Wave speed increases with increasing tension
- Wave speed decreases with increasing linear density:
	- $$v_{string} = \sqrt{\frac{T_{s}}{\mu}}$$
### Sound Waves
- When a loudspeaker cone moves forward, it compresses the air in front of it.
- The **compression** is the disturbance that travels through the air
- **sound wave is a longitudinal wave**
- motion of the sound waves determined by the properties of the air
