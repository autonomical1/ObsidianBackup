### The Wave Model
- The **wave model** describes the basic properties of waves and emphasizes those aspects of wave behaviors common to all waves.
- **travelling wave** is an organized disturbance that travels with a well-defined wave speed

### Mechanical Waves
- **Mechanical Waves**: involve motion of the substance through which they move. Substance = medium
- **Disturbance**: wave that passes through a medium, displacing the atoms that make up the medium from their equilibrium position
