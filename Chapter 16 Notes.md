### The Wave Model
- The **wave model** describes the basic properties of waves and emphasizes those aspects of wave behaviors common to all waves.
- **travelling wave** is an organized disturbance that travels with a well-defined wave speed

### Mechanical Waves
- **Mechanical Waves**: involve motion of the substance through which they move. Substance = medium
- **Disturbance**: wave that passes through a medium, displacing the atoms that make up the medium from their equilibrium position
	- travels with a **wave speed**
	- wave transfers energy, but **medium as a whole does not travel**
- **Waves transfer energy, but it does not transfer any material or substance outward from the source.**

### Electromagnetic and Matter Waves
- **Electromagnetic waves**: waves of an *electromagnetic field*. Includes visible light, radio waves, microwaves, etc.
	- req. no material medium and can travel through a vacuum.
- **Matter waves:** wave-like characteristics of material particles such as electrons and atoms

### Transverse and Longitudinal Waves
- **transverse**: wave in which the particles in the medium move perpendicularly to the direction in which the waves travels. 
- **longitudinal**: particles in the medium move parallel to the direction in which the wave travels.
	- sound waves are the most common form of longitudinal waves.
