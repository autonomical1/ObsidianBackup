### The Wave Model
- The **wave model** describes the basic properties of waves and emphasizes those aspects of wave behaviors common to all waves.
- **travelling wave** is an organized disturbance that travels with a well-defined wave speed

### Mechanical Waves
- **Mechanical Waves**: involve motion of the substance through which they move. Substance = medium
- **Disturbance**: wave that passes through a medium, displacing the atoms that make up the medium from their equilibrium position
	- travels with a **wave speed**
	- wave transfers energy, but **medium as a whole does not travel**
- **Waves transfer energy, but it does not transfer any material or substance outward from the source.**

### Electromagnetic and Matter Waves
- **Electromagnetic waves**: waves of an *electromagnetic field*. Includes visible light, radio waves, microwaves, etc.
	- req. no material medium and can travel through a vacuum.
- **Matter waves:** wave-like characteristics of material particles such as electrons and atoms

### Transverse and Longitudinal Waves
- **transverse**: wave in which the particles in the medium move perpendicularly to the direction in which the waves travels. 
- **longitudinal**: particles in the medium move parallel to the direction in which the wave travels.
	- sound waves are the most common form of longitudinal waves.
- earthquake waves: S waves (transverse) and P waves (longitudinal)

# 16.2 - Travelling Waves
### Wave Speed is a Property of the Medium
- **The wave speed does not depend on the size and shape of the pulse, how the pulse was generated, or how far it has traveled.**
- speed depends on mass-to-length ratio, the **linear density** of the string
	- $$\mu = \frac{m}{L}$$
- Wave speed increases with increasing tension
- Wave speed decreases with increasing linear density:
	- $$v_{string} = \sqrt{\frac{T_{s}}{\mu}}$$
- For calculations, use speed of sound in the air ($20 \degree C$)
- **Speed of light**
### Sound Waves
- When a loudspeaker cone moves forward, it compresses the air in front of it.
- The **compression** is the disturbance that travels through the air
- **sound wave is a longitudinal wave**
- motion of the sound waves determined by the properties of the air

### Sinusoidal Waves
- **sinusoidal wave**: type of wave produced by a source that oscillates with simple harmonic motion
- **amplitude**: *A*, maximum value of displacement
	- crests have displacement of $A$ and troughs have displacement of $-A$ 
- **wavelength**: distance in one cycle of motion
- $$y(x) = A \cos{2\pi \frac{x}{\lambda}}$$
	- In distance $x=\lambda$, phase shift $2\pi$
	- Wave number: $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$
- $$y(x = \lambda) = A \cos (\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\lambda)$$
- Wave frequency is related to the period T = 1/f, exactly the same as in SHM. Motion of the point is: $$y(t) = A \cos (2\pi \frac{t}{T})$$
- **Wave function:**$$y(x,t) = A \cos(2\pi(\frac{x}{\lambda} - \frac{t}{T}))$$
	- negative changes to positive if the wave is moving left

### The Fundamental Relationship for sinusoidal waves
- During a time interval of exactly one period T, each crest of a sinusoidal wave travels forward at a distance of exactly one wavelength: $$v = \frac{distance}{time} = \frac{\lambda}{T}$$
- In terms of frequency:$$v = \lambda f$$
### Light and other EM waves
- EM wave is oscillation of the electromagnetic field
- visible light, radio waves, microwaves, etc.
- All EM waves travel through a vacuum at the same speed: $c = 3.00 \cdot 10^{8}$
	- $$C = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{0}\mu_{0}}}$$

# 16.1 - Principle of Superposition
### Reflections
- A wave pulse traveling along a strong attached to a wall will be reflected when it reaches the wall/boundary
- All of the wave's energy will be reflected; hence **the amplitude of a wave reflected from a boundary is unchanged**
- Waves also reflect from a discontinuity, a point where there is a change in the properties of the medium.
- At a discontinuity, some of the wave's energy is transmitted forward and some is reflected

### What is Light?
- Has property of both waves and particles
- 3 models:
	- Wave model: wave optics
	- Ray model: light travels in a straight line
		- ray optics
	- Photon models: photons have both wave-like and photon-like particles. photons = quanta of light


### The Propagation of Light Waves
- A water wave passes through a window-like opening in a barrier.
- Wave spreads out to fill the space behind the opening. **Diffraction**
	- clear sign that the wave is passing through the opening
- When the opening is many times larger than the wavelength of the wave, the wave continues to move straight forward
- This is similar to the straight-line appearance of light with sharp shadows as light passes through large windows.
