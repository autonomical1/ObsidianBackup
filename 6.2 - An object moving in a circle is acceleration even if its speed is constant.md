- **uniform circular motion**: when an object goes moves in circular motion at a constant speed
- **centripetal acceleration**: center seeking; acceleration is pointed towards the middle of the circular motion
# Analyzing Motion in a circle
- (delta)(theta) = (delta)s / r
- if the time interval between points 1 and 2 is short, theta is small
- nonuniform circular motion works well with a(cent) =  v^2 / r
