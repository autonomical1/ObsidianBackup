**Potential Energy**: stored by all conservative forces
- Gravitation, spring, electromagnetic
- When $\Delta K = 0$, $\Delta E = W_{ext}$, so $\Delta U_{C} = W_{ext} = -W_{c}$
**we can determine the electric potential energy of a charge when it's at a particular position by computing how much work it took to move the charge to that position.
