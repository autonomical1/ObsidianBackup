**Potential Energy**: stored by all conservative forces
- Gravitation, spring, electromagnetic
- When $\Delta K = 0$, $\Delta E = W_{ext}$, so $\Delta U_{C} = W_{ext} = -W_{c}$
**we can determine the electric potential energy of a charge when it's at a particular position by computing how much work it took to move the charge to that position.
# Electric Potential
- a charged particle's potential energy is proportional to its charge.
- **electric potential**: "potential for creating potential energy"
- $$U_{elec} = q\cdot V$$
	- similar to $\overrightarrow{F}_{elec} = q \cdot \overrightarrow{E}$
- Unit = volt (V)
**Sources of Potential:**
- Consider an uncharged capacitor:
	- $\overrightarrow{E} = 0$, so $\Delta V_{c} = E \cdot d = 0$
	- Source of $\Delta V$ is the separation of charges
	- Positive charges have positive potential
	- Negative charges have negative potential
	- $\overrightarrow{E}$ points from high to low potential
 Electric potential at position x inside a capacitor is:
	- $V = \frac{x}{d}\Delta V_{c}$
