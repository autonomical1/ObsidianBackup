# Magnetism
- A magnet free to pivot is a **compass**
- Like poles repel, unlike poles attract
- *Magnetic poles and electric charges share some similar behavior, but they are not the same*

# The Magnetic Field
- *Every magnet sets up a magnetic field in the space around it*
- Symbol: $\overrightarrow{B}$
	- represents strength/magnitude of field

# Measuring the Magnetic Field
- An electric dipole rotates to line up with the electric field
	- electric dipole experiences a torque when placed in an electric field
- The compass, a magnetic dipole, rotates so that its north pole points in the direction of the magnetic field.
	- A magnetic field exerts a torque on the compass needle, causing the needle to point in the field direction
- Iron filings allow you to see the magnetic field lines
