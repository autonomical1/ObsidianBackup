 Magnetism
- A magnet free to pivot is a **compass**
- Like poles repel, unlike poles attract
- *Magnetic poles and electric charges share some similar behavior, but they are not the same*

# The Magnetic Field
- *Every magnet sets up a magnetic field in the space around it*
- Symbol: $\overrightarrow{B}$
	- represents strength/magnitude of field

# Measuring the Magnetic Field
- An electric dipole rotates to line up with the electric field
	- electric dipole experiences a torque when placed in an electric field
- The compass, a magnetic dipole, rotates so that its north pole points in the direction of the magnetic field.
	- A magnetic field exerts a torque on the compass needle, causing the needle to point in the field direction
- Iron filings allow you to see the magnetic field lines
- *Magnetic field of a magnet points away from the north pole and toward the south pole*
### Magnetic Field Vectors and Field Lines
- **Magnetic field vector**: useful to represent the magnetic field at one particular point
- **Magnetic field lines**: overall representation of the field
	- can close in on each other and form loops

### The Magnetic Field of the Earth
- *The south pole of the earth's magnet is located near - not exactly coincident with - the earth's south end*

# Electric Currents also create Magnetic Fields
- Compass with react to the presence of a bar magnet
	- will also deflect if you place the compass near a wire and pass a current through the wire. 
- Magnetic field lines form circles around the wire. Magnetic force strength decreases as distance from wire increases.

- Magnetic field lines curve through the center of the look and back through the loop's center, forming complete closed curves. The field lines far from loop look like field lines from a bar magnet.

- Magnetic field lines due to currents have no start or end, they  form complete closed curves
- Ordinary magnets are often called permanent magnets to distinguish between electromagnets.
### Magnetic Field of a Straight, Current Carrying Wire
- **Right-Hand Rule of Fields**

### Calculating the Magnetic Field due to a Current
- Magnetic field strengths are measured in **Tesla**, T
- The magnitude of the magnetic field around a long, straight current-carrying wire depends on the distance r from the wire and the *current* I through the wire:
	- $$B = \frac{\mu_{0}I}{2\pi r}$$(Magnetic field due to a long, straight current-carrying wire)
	- $\mu_0$ is the **permeability constant**. It relates the strength of the magnetic field to the currents that produce it.
		- $\mu_{0} = 1.26 * 10^{-6}$ $T \cdot m/A$ $= 4\pi * 10^{-7}$ $T\cdot \frac{m}{A}$
### Magnetic Fields from More than One Source
- The total magnetic field at any point is the vector sum of the individual fields at that point. This is the principle of superposition.
### Current Loops
- The magnetic field due to a current loop is more complex than that of a straight wire.
- Because the loop can be thought of as a wire bent into a circle, the expression for the strength of the field at the center of the loop is similar to that of a wire.
- $$B = \frac{\mu_{0}I}{2R}$$(Magnetic field at the center of a current loop of radius R)
- If N loops of wire carrying the same current I are all tightly wound into a single flat coil, then the magnitude of the field at the center is just N times bigger (since we're imposing N individual current loops):
	- $$B = \frac{\mu_{0}NI}{2R}$$
### Solenoids
- The field inside a solenoid is fairly uniform.
- The greater the ratio of N turns of wire to the length L of the solenoid (N/L), the stronger the field inside will be. 
- The strength of the field will also be proportional to the current. The field does not depend on the radius of the solenoid.
- $$B = \frac{\mu_{0}NI}{L} = \mu_{0}nI$$

### Magnetic Fields exert forces on moving charges
- Magnetic fields also exert forces on moving charged particles and on electric currents in wires
- If charge is stationary or moves parallel to a magnetic field, there is no magnetic force
- As the angle $\alpha$ between the velocity and the magnetic field increases, the magnetic force also increases. The force is greatest when the angle is 90$\degree$ The magnetic force is always perpendicular to the plane containing $\overrightarrow{v}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$

### Paths of Charged Particles in Magnetic Fields
- A particle moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field undergoes uniform circular motion at constant speed.
