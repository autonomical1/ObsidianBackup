WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department announced on Friday it is awarding $703 million for 41 port infrastructure projects in 22 states and American Samoa, according to documents seen by Reuters.

The funds will boost coastal, Great Lakes, and inland river ports. The awards seek to improve supply chain reliability, electrify equipment, improve or create new rail and highway connections, boost offshore wind projects and cut greenhouse gas emissions.

The projects are funded by a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law signed into law by President Joe Biden in November 2021.

"We're awarding record levels of funding to improve our port infrastructure, strengthen our supply chains, and help cut costs for American families," Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said.

Salem, Massachusetts was awarded nearly $34 million to redevelop a vacant industrial facility for offshore wind energy projects, including construction of a 700-foot-long wharf.
