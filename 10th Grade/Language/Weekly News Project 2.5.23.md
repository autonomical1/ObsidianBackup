# Summary
Recently, a Chinese spy balloon was spotted and shot down above the U.S. The Secretary of State Antony Blinken was planning on visiting China in days before the surveillance balloon was spotted. If the Secretary were to have followed through with his visit, it would be dominated by repairing relations after the balloon, instead of more pressing issues like Taiwan and other economic clashes. 
# Analysis
The author has portrayed some amount of bias against China, specifically by how they have used the specific quotes from Chinese officials, and counterargued with American ideas. They also include several appeals to the audience, specifically acknowledging the confusion and speculation that could come from the current events and actions prompted by the Chinese surveillance balloon.
# Personal Response
I personally think that it was a very good idea not to pursue a visit to China, especially in the wake of current events. It would have definitely made the visit much more provocative in terms of how it would affect US-China relations. It also showed how fragile the relations between the US and China really are, and how shady the Chinese government was and is becoming.
