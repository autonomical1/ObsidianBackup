# Summary
The article reports that tensions have escalated between Russia and Ukraine in recent weeks, with both sides accusing each other of violating a ceasefire agreement reached in July 2020. During a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Putin warned Ukraine against any military action in the eastern region of Donbass, saying it could have "colossal" consequences for Ukrainian statehood. Zelensky urged Putin to help calm the situation and withdraw Russian troops from the border area. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden has voiced his support for Ukraine and reportedly offered military assistance. The conflict in Donbass began in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and backed separatists.
# Analysis
The article provides a mostly fair account of the phone call between Putin and Zelensky, but some language choices could be biased. The use of words like "tensions have risen" suggests a subjective view, and mentioning Biden's support for Ukraine may appear biased towards Ukraine. Overall, the article uses objective language but requires careful reading to avoid any potential biases.
# Personal Response
I think the way that Russia handles diplomatic relations with other countries, especially regarding Ukraine, is plain wrong and bad. They are entirely handling it incorrectly, as well as being way too aggressive in all of their fronts. I think Russia should be less aggressive and more diplomatic, and negotiate instead of fight.
