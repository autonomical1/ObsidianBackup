# Summary 
The U.S Transportation Department is providing $703 million to ports in multiple cities and states, to further the coastal, Great Lakes, and river ports. They are being funded by the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan set by President Biden late last year. The cities and states being awarded money are: Alaska, New York, Salem, Columbus, Detroit, Camden, Long Beach, and Aberdeen.

# Personal Response
I took away the fact that the Transportation Department is using $703 million to further the economy, which is the exact reason that the $1 trillion infrastructure plan was set into place by President Biden. This is a good use of the money, because it allows the United States to have an inland boost in economy, which will create many opportunities to many people that are less-exposed to that kind of work.
