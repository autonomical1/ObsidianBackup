# Summary
Boeing's former chief executive Dennis Muilenburg is being fined $1,000,000, and the company itself is being charged $200,000,000 by the SEC for putting out misleading statements surrounding the 737 Max crashes. The crashes that occurred between 2019 and 2020 were due to a malfunction in the MCAS, or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). The company and then former chief assured the public that the certification process for the MCAS was foolproof, and there shouldn't have been any kind of mishaps related to it.
# Analysis
The way the writer wrote this article is very unbiased towards both any government entity and Boeing. They present their facts in an impartial way, by only providing direct quotes from interviews, and statistics from known public data. The purpose of the article is to inform the public about the mishaps of Boeing and its former chief executive. The intended audience is people with an inert interest in aviation, as well as investors who may have money put into Boeing. 
# Personal Response
My personal takeaway from this article is that investors have lost a large amount of money, due to the problems that have arisen from Boeing's questionable choices in presenting information about the problems in the 737 Max. This does indirectly affect me, since Boeing is very prominent in the aviation industry, and I fly a lot. Some flights that I may take could be on one of the 737 Max's, which could cause a conflict of interest, because Boeing's actions could cause a loss of trust among many.
