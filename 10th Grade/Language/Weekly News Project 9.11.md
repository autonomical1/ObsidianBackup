# Summary
The main cause of the housing recession is rising mortgage rates, which caused monthly payments on mortgages to be upwards of $700 more since January 2022. Also, the prices on homes are higher and the supply of these new homes have increased. Homebuilders are not building as many homes because there are not enough buyers looking to buy their homes. Recently (June/July), home prices have decreased.
