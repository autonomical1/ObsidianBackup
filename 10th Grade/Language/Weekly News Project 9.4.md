# Summary
Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, has deduced that there will be a recession next year due to increasing money supply. He bases this information of the M2 measure, which indicates the total money supply and future inflataion. According to Hanke, the "money supply has stagnated", which will eventually lead to an "economic slowdown." He also said that inflation will stay high due to "unprecedented growth" in money supply due to COVID. He thinks that the Fed Chair (Jerome Powell) is not focusing on the right reason for the increases.

# Personal Response
My personal takeaway from this article is that a recession, which is normal, but still bad for the economy, is coming. I believe Steve Hanke, because he is a credible person, due to the fact that he studies applied economics at a renowned university. The article also allowed me to understand why Hanke was able to deduce the fact that a recession is coming, based on a metric known as M2, which measures total money supply and future inflation.
