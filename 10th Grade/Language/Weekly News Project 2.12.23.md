# Summary

The College Board has denied claims of negotiating the content of its new African American Studies course with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis or any other state. The organization says its only contact with Florida was regarding the filing of paperwork for the pilot course and explaining why the course is not in violation of state laws. The College Board has faced criticism from Democratic governors for excluding topics such as Black queer studies and Black Lives Matters from the course framework, which sparked outrage among education advocates. The Florida Department of Education is expected to review the course for consideration in schools starting next fall.
# Analysis

The CollegeBoard article presents a balanced analysis of the recent election win, despite the organization's known liberal leanings. The author highlights the unprecedented length of the voting process, making it an intriguing event. The article finishes with a personal touch, suggesting that another member's involvement could ignite a challenge against McCarthy. The author's neutral tone and absence of partisan commentary makes the analysis trustworthy and credible. The focus remains on the unique aspects of the election, rather than taking a political stance. The article effectively informs readers about the historical significance of the event.

# Personal Response
My personal takeaway is that the idea that allowing governments to have any amount of control on content of any classes is wrong. It is even part of the constitution to not allow any main government agencies to control the content in classes. I also think that CollegeBoard should not be allowed to have anyone other than subject experts alter course content for  any of their classes,

### Magnetic Fields exert forces on moving charges
- Magnetic fields also exert forces on moving charged particles and on electric currents in wires
- If charge is stationary or moves parallel to a magnetic field, there is no magnetic force
- As the angle $\alpha$ between the velocity and the magnetic field increases, the magnetic force also increases. The force is greatest when the angle is 90$\degree$ The magnetic force is always perpendicular to the plane containing $\overrightarrow{v}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$

### Paths of Charged Particles in Magnetic Fields
- A particle moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field undergoes uniform circular motion at constant speed.
- $$F = \frac{mv^{2}}{r}$$--------------------------------------------------------------------$$F = |q|vB = \frac{mv^{2}}{r}$$--------------------------------------------------------------------$$r = \frac{mv}{|q|B}$$
