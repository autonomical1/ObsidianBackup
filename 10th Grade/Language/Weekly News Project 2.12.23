# Summary

The College Board has denied claims of negotiating the content 
of its new African American Studies course with Florida Governor 
Ron DeSantis or any other state. The organization says its only 
contact with Florida was regarding the filing of paperwork for 
the pilot course and explaining why the course is not in violation
of state laws. The College Board has faced criticism from Democratic 
governors for excluding topics such as Black queer studies and Black Lives 
Matters from the course framework, which sparked outrage among education advocates. 
The Florida Department of Education is expected to review the course for consideration 
in schools starting next fall.
