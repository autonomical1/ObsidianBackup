# Summary
On Friday, December 4th, 2022, President Biden put into statute a contract between labor unions and the freight rail industry to prevent any event of a rail shutdown that could have ruined the economy. Rail workers desired more sick paid leave and how the unions were not able to get rail operators to agree. The bill passed through the House, which was proposed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, however, there was not enough support in the Senate for the base bill.
# Analysis
The journalist employs very direct and straightforward language. They use language that is easily understood for the general man, who wouldn't really understand any complicated political jargon. They gave a simple rundown on how Senate and House voting works.
# Personal Response
I took away the fact that Joe Biden passed a bill that will prevent an economic collapse. This is very important because every person in America depends on the economy very heavily. Since there are so many industries that rely on rail to function, a rail strike would have been devastating. Prices for goods were already high because of inflation, but if the rail strike were to take place, it would hyperinflate the prices.
