### The Magnetic Field
- *Every magnet sets up a magnetic field in the space around it*
- Symbol: $\overrightarrow{B}$
	- represents strength/magnitude of field

### Measuring the Magnetic Field
- An electric dipole rotates to line up with the electric field
	- electric dipole experiences a torque when placed in an electric field
- The compass, a magnetic dipole, rotates so that its north pole points in the direction of the magnetic field.
	- A magnetic field exerts a torque on the compass needle, causing the needle to point in the field direction
- Iron filings allow you to see the magnetic field lines
- *Magnetic field of a magnet points away from the north pole and toward the south pole*
### Magnetic Field Vectors and Field Lines
- **Magnetic field vector**: useful to represent the magnetic field at one particular point
- **Magnetic field lines**: overall representation of the field
	- can close in on each other and form loops

### The Magnetic Field of the Earth
- *The south pole of the earth's magnet is located near - not exactly coincident with - the earth's south end*

# Summary
On Friday, December 4th, 2022, President Biden put into statute a contract between labor unions and the freight rail industry to prevent any event of a rail shutdown that could have ruined the economy. Rail workers desired more sick paid leave and how the unions were not able to get rail operators to agree. The bill passed through the House, which was proposed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, however, there was not enough support in the Senate for the base bill.
# Analysis
The journalist employs very direct and straightforward language. They use language that is easily understood for the general man, who wouldn't really understand any complicated political jargon. They gave a simple rundown on how Senate and House voting works.
# Personal Response
I took away the fact that Joe Biden passed a bill that will prevent an economic collapse. This is very important because every person in America depends on the economy very heavily. Since there are so many industries that rely on rail to function, a rail strike would have been devastating. Prices for goods were already high because of inflation, but if the rail strike were to take place, it would hyperinflate the prices.
