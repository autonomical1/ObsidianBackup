# Summary
On Wednesday, August 24th, 2022, new rules put in place by the Biden administration put restrictions on homemade firearm kits that can create "ghost guns" to initiate heavier gun control by putting them in the same category as traditional firearms. These regulations require that the main parts of the guns ("the frames and recievers") have serial numbers. They also require buyers to undergo background checks, and make sellers obtain permits to sell them. 

# Analysis
The way that the author does not elaborate on how the NRA criticizes the statement and doesn't reiterate any information from that article leads the reader to believe that they are not wanting to show any bias towards the NRA. They lay out the article where they explain what the new rules do, then the criticisms done by citizens and interest groups, in the form of lawsuits and the NRA criticisms. 

# Personal Response
My personal takeaway from this article is that it is an important rule that needs to be put into place, just because the build-at-home kits for guns is an insanely dangerous device that must be put into check. It allowed me to understand what a ghost gun is and why it must be restricted. It does elicit an emotional response because guns that cannot be tracked are one of the most dangerous things in our society, as well as its involvement with the Uvalde crisis. I knew that the Biden administration had a plan to increase gun control which I find very important.
