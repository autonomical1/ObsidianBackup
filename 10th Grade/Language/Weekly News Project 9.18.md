# Summary
The stocks on Wall Street fell very heavily during this past week due to warnings from FedEx surrounding the declining trends of the economy. All of the major indexes have shown considerable losses for the past 4 weeks. The FedEx stock decreased by 21% due to their warning that their 1st-quarter earnings would be less than expected due to slow business. High inflation and high interest rates have caused a slow in economy, which also caused a sell-off in the stock market. 
# Analysis
The author has shown very little bias towards their topic. They are very straight-forward about the way they present the data, because it is not an opinion piece. This leads to them presenting hard facts and statistics, which increases the credibility of their data. The author's purpose is to inform the readers about how the stock market performed this past week. This is important because it gives an insight on who the audience is. The intended audience for this article is people that pay attention to the stock market, or have money invested. 
# Personal Response
My personal takeaway is that the government hiking up interest rates in an attempt to combat inflation is leading to a very rapid decrease in the performance of the stock market. I think that the use of increasing interest rates is heavily detrimental on the stock market, and as the article said, in the technology sector, which I pay the most attention to. However, since I don't have money invested, and I just pay attention to the stock market as a way to keep an eye on how companies are doing, this article doesn't have an effect on my day-to-day.
