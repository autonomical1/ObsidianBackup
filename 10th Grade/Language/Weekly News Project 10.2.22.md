# Summary
Consumers spent more money this August even though inflation is high. The economy is on a straight trend even though there are increasing interest rates, stock market volatility, and high inflation. Prices jumped almost 6% between this and last year. The Fed is increasing their interest rates in order to slow borrowing and spending, which will end up reducing inflation problems throughout the economy.

# Analysis
The author uses very minimalistic language to denote that there is no bias towards the Fed. They present many facts and statistics to show only a logical approach to their claim. They also use credible sources like the Federal Reserve, Commerce Department, and other unnamed economists. They also provide dates and times when they received the information, to ensure the audience that the data they are showing is recent and not outdated. 

# Personal Response
My personal takeaway is that the economy is still thriving, even though high interest rates, high inflation, and the extremely fickle stock market is putting a toll on it. I am affected by this because I am one of the many consumers in the country that are buying things. Everything has increased in price, from the snacks at the snack bar, to common everyday items, which has put a toll on my spending.
