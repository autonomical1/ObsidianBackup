During a phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Putin warned Ukraine against any military action in the eastern region of Donbass, saying it could have "colossal" consequences for Ukrainian statehood. Zelensky urged Putin to help calm the situation and withdraw Russian troops from the border area.
