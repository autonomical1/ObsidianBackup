# Song 1: "Crazy Train" - Ozzy Osbourne
1. What is the overall message of the song? **The overall message of this song is about how Osbourne sees the state of the world and how society treats each other. He talks about how people act as enemies and how people can still act better to each other. He references government control and the aftermath of the Cold War. This shows his anti-war sentiment and how it affects him personally.**
2. In what specific ways (give textual and/or visual evidence) does the song showcase this time period? **The distorted image as well as the very powerful guitar riffs portray how Osbourne feels towards the topics he touches on in the song, which is one of insanity and discordance. He also uses the same chorus "I'm going off the rails like a crazy train" which notates how he's going insane after society delves into darkness.**
3. What is your opinion of the song? Why? **I think this song is a very accurate portrayal of the feelings that could have been felt during the time, especially among people with anti-war sentiments. This song would definitely resonate with them. I also think that this song was good musically as well, because of the extremely powerful guitar.**
