### Unit 5, Lesson 1 ([[HON BIO A]])
1. DNA (or *deoxyribonucleic acid*)is the molecule that carries all genetic information for every cell in any organism alive. DNA is a nucleic acid, which is one of the 4 biomolecules of organisms. It is contained in the nucleus for eukaryotes, and remains free-floating in prokaryotes. It has 3 different components: a deoxyribose sugar, phosphate backbone, and a nitrogen base. These nitrogen bases create base pairs with their complementary nucleotides by forming hydrogen bonds, which bend the strand of DNA to create the double helix. There are 4 different nitrogen bases: Adenine (A), which pairs with Thymine (T), and Cytosine (C) which pairs with Guanine (G). DNA directs protein synthesis and cell division, while also creating specialized cells in multicellular organisms.  Through the process of mitosis, the cell begins to divide into two daughter cells with identical DNA.  
2. DNA is the backbone of life, which is why everyone lives and breathes. The way humans replicate and have children are entirely based on DNA. Sexual reproduction works in almost the same way via meiosis, where the sperm and egg do something similar to mitosis. 
3. I find it really interesting how DNA in general works, and how it even can cause specialization of cells. I still don't really understand how the cell knows what to specialize in, since DNA is just a strand of information.
