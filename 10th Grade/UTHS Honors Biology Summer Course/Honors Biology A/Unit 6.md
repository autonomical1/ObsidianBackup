### Unit 6, Lesson 5 ([[HON BIO A]])
1. Mutations are random changes that occur in DNA. These can happen due to a mistake in replication, exposure to radiation, or a chemical reaction with DNA. They are much more likely to be harmful or have no effect on the organism than they are to be beneficial. There are four types of mutations: substitution, insertion, deletion, and frameshift. Frameshifts occur when there is a insertion or deletion of bases in the DNA sequence. These are very detrimental, since it changes the entire amino acid sequence after the insertion/deletion. Substitution mutations occur when one or more bases are replaced with another base. These have the potential to cause a single amino acid change, no change, or switch an amino acid to a stop codon.
2. Down syndrome is a product of a mutation of the DNA in a fetus, which occurs when there is a problem in the replicating cells of the fetus. It is most likely multiple frameshift mutations that contribute to it, since it is a loss of a chromosome, which is necessary to have functioning, normal DNA.
3. I find it really interesting how even if a mutation occurs, it can be dealt with relatively quickly. Since some of these mistakes can occur when there is a problem in replicating DNA to mRNA, it can go away quickly, but can also cause problems in the long term.
