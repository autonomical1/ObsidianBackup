### Unit 1, Lesson 4 ([[HON BIO A]])

1. The objective of this lesson is to introduce you to the four different types of biomolecules found in every living organisms' body. You will learn each of their structures, functions, and sources.
2. I have had experience learning about these molecules because I learned this in 8th grade, and I understand how they are used in the body. I also am consistently in contact with these things in my everyday life, since they are part of everything I eat.
3. I still am astonished by the fact that out of 22 different amino acids, an endless number of proteins can be made that can carry out so many different functions and that they can be used to do anything from break things down to build muscle and cells.
