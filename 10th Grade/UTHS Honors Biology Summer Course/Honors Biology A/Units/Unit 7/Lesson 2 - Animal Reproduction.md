- Reproductive system contains necessary structures for gamete formation, fertilization, and development of offspring

### Reproductive System
- occurs when genetic material from two individuals combine to create offspring
- required for continuation and adaptation of species and relies heavily on interactions among multiple body systems

### Male Reproductive System
- main function is to create and supply sperm
	- contain half of the genetic material needed to create offspring as a result of meiosis
- occurs in testicles and is continual process across lifespan

### Female Reproductive System
- create and supply egg cells - produced by meiosis
	- contain half of genetic material for offspring
- egg cell fertilized by sperm cell, all genetic info needed for offspring is present
- females undergo meiosis and create all egg cells before they're born
- held in ovaries and once female reaches puberty, every 28 days, ovaries release egg cell
- if sperm present when female ovulates, egg cell can be fertilized and will implant in structure called the **uterus**
- this is when fetus develops

### Endocrine System
- main function is formation and regulation of hormones
- in reproduction, act as stimulators in male and female reproductive systems
- testosterone for sperm cells, estrogen and progesterone for females - stimulate ovulation
	- progesterone is key component in fertilization
- HCG ensures that fertilized egg cell not released during what would be female's normal menstruation cycle
- oxytocin stimulates production of milk

### Circulatory System
- transports nutrients and oxygen throughout body
- fetus is given access to mother's nutritional supply through structure called umbilical cord
	- attached to fetus' midsection
- placenta is a sac-like structure that allows vital nutrition and oxygen from mother's blood to enter fetus and waste products from fetus to exit.

### Digestive System
- breaks down food and absorbs nutrients into blood stream
	- nutrients delivered to fetus via circulatory system

### Muscular System
- movement for animal body
- powerful muscle contractions guide fetus through birth canal and out of the mother
