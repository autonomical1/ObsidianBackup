- Humans have 46 chromosomes - contain all of our DNA
- mother and father both have 23 chromosomes which are given to child - which have 46 chromosomes
- Humans reproduce sexually - 2 organisms within species exchange genetic information to produce offspring that are genetically unique.
- **Meiosis**: type of cellular division that results in teh formation of unique **gametes** (sex cells), which have half of the original genetic material.
	- Males: sperm; Females: eggs

### The Structure of Chromosomes
- ![[Pasted image 20230710200112.jpg]]
	- thread-like structures that contain DNA
	- w/in nucleus of cell, DNA in relaxed, uncoiled form known as chromatin
	- in mito/meiosis, uncoiled DNA condenses tightly into structures - **chromosomes**
	- each chromosome made up of 2 indiv. structures - **chromatids**
		- identical pieces of genetic material formed after the process of DNA replication - **sister chromatids**
			- held together at **centromere**

- Most animals and plants are **diploid** - 2 sets of chromosomes
	- one set from mother, other from father
	- each chromosome pairs with another chromosome that has the same genes in same location - **homologous chromosomes**

### Meiosis
- type of cellular division - results in formation of *gametes* or sex cells. 
- many similar mechanisms to mitosis, end results are different
- mitosis results in two identical daughter cells; meiosis results in 4 unique gametes that contain half of the genetic information - **haploid**
- to reduce amount of genetic material in each gamete - two rounds of division called Meiosis I and II

### Meiosis I
- Stages: **prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase**
- ![[Pasted image 20230710223510.jpg]]

#### Prophase I
- First stage of meiotic cellular division
- nuclear envelope begins to break apart, homologous chromosomes begin to pair side-by-side
- as homologous chromosomes are paired, chromosomes w/in each pair move so close to each other, some portions of genetic material touch and switch places
	- this is *crossing over*
		- partly responsible for amount of diversity
		- ![[Pasted image 20230710223803.png]]

#### Metaphase I
- homologous pairs line up in middle of cell - forms *tetrads*
- ordering of these tetrads completely random which allow for diversity
- this is **independent assortment**
- spindle fibers growing from the centrioles at the polar ends of the cell connect w/ each chromosome for next phase

#### Telophase I and Cytokinesis
- As each set of chromosomes each opposite sides of cell - each cell is now haploid (one set of chromosomes)
	- now undergo a second round of division

### Meiosis II
- each individual chromosome is made up of two individual (sister) chromatids 
- before crossing over, they are identical; now are unique and begin to separate, dividing one more time to create 4 unique, haploid gametes

#### Prophase II
- begins to break apart nuclear envelope, and any relaxed chromatin recondenses into chromosomes
	- centrioles begin migration to polar opposite ends of cell, spindle fibers reappear

#### Metaphase II
- chromosomes begin to move toward center of cell
- 23 individual chromosomes lined up in center and not homologous pairs
- spindle fibers connect to each indv. chromatid

#### Anaphase II
- spindle fibers begin to retract and pull chromosomes apart - individual chromatids will migrate to opposite ends of cell

#### Telophase II
- As 23 chromatids gather at each end of cell, two new nuclei will form around each group of genetic material
- cell undergoes cytokinesis and 4 unique haploid cells form
- each gamete genetically unique from all others that are created due to both crossing over and independent assortments
