- The cell cycle is regulated by specific proteins called *regulatory proteins*, which send a signal directly to the cell to speed up or slow down the cell cycle. 
	- they can also act like checkpoints
		- preventing steps from being skipped over
- Cell cycle is either promoted or inhibited by proteins like *cyclin*. 
- If these regulatory proteins become defective, could lead to disease - cancer
