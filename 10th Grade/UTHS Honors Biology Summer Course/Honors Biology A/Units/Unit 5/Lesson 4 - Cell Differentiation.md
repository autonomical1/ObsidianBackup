- All cells carry out basic metabolic processes since they all have simple needs and characteristics for survival. 
	- unicellular organisms carry out all life processes in one cell
- multicellular organisms are made of many cells, which can specialize
- **cell differentiation** - process by which cells specialize to perform different processes provide an advantage for organisms. 
	- blood, muscle and epithelial cells all came from the process of mitosis, but they all developed in their own ways to specialize.

### Role of DNA and RNA in Cell Differentiation
- DNA controls gene expression - physical traits, as well as specific genetic info.
- DNA -> mRNA -> chain of amino acids to create proteins.

### Role of Environmental Factors
