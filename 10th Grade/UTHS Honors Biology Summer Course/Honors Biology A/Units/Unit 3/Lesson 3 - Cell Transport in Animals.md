1. Egg in Corn Syrup: Nothing will happen since the egg is in an isotonic solution.
2. Egg in Salt Water: The egg will shrivel up, because the egg is in a hypertonic solution and water leaves the egg.
3. Egg in Tap Water: The egg will get larger, since the egg is in a hypotonic solution.

## Interactions between Red Blood Cell and Hypertonic, Isotonic, and Hypotonic Solutions
![[Pasted image 20230626195007.jpg|700]]
- since cells only have cell membrane, they can't handle large amounts of water entering cells
- Hypotonic = Blows up
	- if too much water enters, cell will lyse and die
- Hypertonic: lose water
	- salt sucks
- most cells in body are isotonic
- also perform functions of diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active transport
