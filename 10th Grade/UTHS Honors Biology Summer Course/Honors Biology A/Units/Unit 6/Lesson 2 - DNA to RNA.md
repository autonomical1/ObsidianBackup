- DNA must be transcribed to create any protein in the cell, since it can't leave the nucleus - this is where RNA comes in. 
- Organisms have DNA and RNA, which differ in their sugars, bases, functions, and locations.
- Structure of RNA:
	- ![[Pasted image 20230710170415.jpg]]
- have the same nitrogen bases - except Thymine from DNA is replaced by Uracil in RNA
- ![[Pasted image 20230710170551.jpg]]\
- DNA stores genetic information, which is stored on one long double-stranded molecule of DNA - present in every cell
- RNA is made of short, complementary strands of DNA which fulfill different roles in cell.
	- 2 funcs: mRNA (copy of gene that eventually becomes protein) and tRNA (matches each codon on mRNA to amino acid)
- located in different areas of cell
	- DNA in nucleus,
	- RNA in cytoplasm
- First part is called **transcription**: short segments of DNA copied onto RNA
	- main enzyme: **RNA polymerase**
		- process is very similar to DNA replication.
	- **STEPS OF TRANSCRIPTION**:
		- RNA polymerase binds to section of DNA in front of gene that will be transcribed - **promoter**
		- Part of RNA polymerase similar to helicase unzips DNA in area of gene
		- Free RNA nucleotides H-bond to gene following base pairing rules
		- RNA polymerase moves down gene and covalently bonds RNA nucleotides together
		- After the gene, section of DNA signals RNA polymerase to stop transcribing and fall off DNA.
		- the 2 strands of DNA come back together and RNA remains single-stranded.
		- mRNA carries gene to ribosome to be translated, tRNA binds to single amino acid to aid in translation, and other types of RNA are also produced.


# Translation Lab
### Pre-Lab Questions
1. Transcription is the process of copying genes from DNA to mRNA.

### Post-Lab Analysis
1. I unzipped the DNA by cutting the two strands in half and separating them. I then got the free RNA nucleotides and matched them using the base pair rules. I zipped up the DNA again by connecting the two strands together.
2. Based off of the base pairing rules: A:U, T:A, C:G
3. Yes, since the uracil is in place of the thymine.
4. It doesn't have the same ordering of nucleotides.
