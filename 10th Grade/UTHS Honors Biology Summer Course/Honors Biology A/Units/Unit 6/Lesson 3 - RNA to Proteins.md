- Translation is the synthesis of proteins from mRNA template.
- cell also needs ribosomes and tRNA to synthesize proteins.
	- ribosomes are organelles in cytoplasm where protein synthesis occurs
		- some are free, some attached to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
		- made of small and large subunit

	- tRNA binds amino acids to one part of itself, then rest of tRNA folds up on itself so that only anticodon shows - this anticodon binds to codon on mRNA to bring appropriate amino acid
- **STEPS OF TRANSLATION**:
	- mRNA fed through ribosome
	- One codon of mRNA shows at a time
	- mRNA codon base pairs w/ tRNA, attached w/ amino acid
	- mRNA moves so next codon shows
	- next codon base pairs w/ tRNA carrying another amino acid
	- Steps 4-6 repeat until ribosome reaches stop codon
- the chain of amino acids produced by this process: **polypeptide**
- undergoes further processing and folding in ER and other organelles

- DNA replication and translation both rely on base pairing.

- amino acids that each codon codes for is called *genetic code*. 
	- same for all organisms
