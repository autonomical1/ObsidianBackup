- Proteins are basis for every biological function a cell performs.
- DNA stores instructions to make proteins. 
- 3 important molecules: **DNA, RNA, and Proteins**
- Initial DNA strand:

- To create proteins, the cell creates a strand of RNA - nucleic acid and stores genetic information like DNA, but uses info for protein synthesis.
	- instead of Thymine (T), has Uracil (U)
- Complementary RNA strand:

- This process is **transcription**: complementary strand of RNA from DNA
	- this specific RNA is called **messenger RNA (mRNA)**
		- carries message of gene from DNA to ribosome to be translated to protein.
- protein made of amino acids, sequence of amino acids determine structure and function of protein
- 20 different types of amino acids
- each 3 nitrogen bases on mRNA is **codon**
	- each codon codes for a specific AA

	- This is the list and key for what codons represent which amino acids

- Process of transcription (DNA -> mRNA) depends on H-bonding
	- For DNA: A=T, G=C
	- For RNA: A=U, G=C
- true for all organisms
- Process of translation (mRNA -> protein) also depends on H-bonding between each codon and appropriate amino acid
