- **mutations**: random changes occurring in DNA
	- much more likely to be harmful/no effect
	- can happen when a mistake in replication occurs.
- There are 4 types of mutations:
	- **substitution**:
		- one base replaced with another base:
			- 5th base from T to A:
				- AACGTGGGTCA to AACG**A**GGGTCA
			- can cause single AA change, no change, or AA to STOP codon
	- **insertion**:
		- 1+ bases added to DNA sequence
			- example of a **frameshift** mutation since every AA after insertion is changed
	- **deletion**: 
		- 1+ bases deleted from DNA sequence
			- also frameshift mutation
