1. Between 0.6 and 0.4 billion years ago.
2. Photosynthesis is the process of converting energy from sunlight to usable energy (ATP) through the interactions between the chloroplast and the mitochondria.
3. Since oxygen was used as the main method of giving life, the abundance of it allowed for more organisms to live, as well as creating the ozone layer, which gave protection to the organisms of the planet against the sun's radiation.


- In photosynthesis, light energy from the sun is used to convert low-nrg $CO_2$ and $H_2 O$ into high-nrg glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$) and $O_2$. Light energy is converted to chemical energy.
- Balanced equation: $$6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{ light energy } \rightarrow  C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$$
	- carbon dioxide + water + energy ==> glucose + oxygen

- occurs in the **chloroplast**
- occurs mostly in the leaves, since they have the largest number of chloroplasts
- Different parts of photosynthesis:
	- **Light-Dependent Reactions**: Light used to split water to produce ATP. $O_2$ is a byproduct.
	- **Calvin Cycle**: ATP energy used to assemble glucose molecules from $CO_2$

1. Light energy splits water to produce glucose and oxygen as a byproduct.
2. Oxygen is created in the light-dependent reactions.
3. ATP is immediately used to create glucose molecules from $CO_2$
4. $CO_2$ provides the carbon used to create the carbon chain in the Calvin Cycle.

- Chloroplasts are surrounded by a double-membrane. 
- **Thylakoids**: stacks of flattened disks, which contain **chlorophyll** - pigment that absorbs light used to power photosynthesis; absorb all colors of light except green, giving green color to plants. 
	- this is where the light-dependent reactions take place
	- fluid that surrounds thylakoids: **stroma**
		- this is where **Calvin Cycle** takes place.
- Water is also necessary since it acts as a reactant of photosynthesis.
	- split by light energy to create **ATP** which drives the **Calvin Cycle**
- Photosynthesis mainly occurs in the leaves of plants. 
- Have pores called **stomata** which allow for gas exchange. $CO_2$ enters via stomata and $O_2$ leaves via stomata.
- regulated by 2 *guard cells* that surround stomata
	- cause stomata to open/close to control gas exchange
	- to conserve water, stomata can be closed when photosynthesis isn't required.

- Plant transports glucose via phloem.
- can be broken down to regenerate ATP

1. Chloroplast has thylakoids and stroma, thylakoids are the main place for the light-dependent reactions, and stroma is the place for the Calvin cycle. 
2. The xylem transports water, the phloem transports glucose (sugar).
3. CO2 enters, O2 leaves via stomata


# Viewing Stomata Lab

1. The stomata that I observed were open. This was because I viewed it during the day.
2. The roots mainly contain xylem cells. This is because the roots are the main source of water collection for the plant. The roots have root hairs that extend farther than the main root structure to increase the surface area of the plant, therefore allowing the plant to take in as much water as possible. The xylem is the main cell that transports water throughout the entire plant. This movement of water also assists the process of photosynthesis, since it brings water to the leaves, which have cells with many chloroplasts, which are the main locations of photosynthesis. After undergoing the process of photosynthesis, the glucose from that process is transported throughout the plant via the phloem, which transports sugars.
