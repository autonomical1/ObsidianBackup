1. The individual dark peppered moths were eaten, and the individual light peppered moths mostly survived and reproduced.
2. The dark peppered moths had a much lower population compared to the light peppered moths.
3. The light peppered moths lived to reproduce.
4. No, because the parents of the individual passed down a specific color.
5. Some were eaten as a result of the predation events.


- Natural selection - different rates of success in which organisms survive and reproduce
	- a.k.a. survival of the fittest

### Genetic Variation
- for populations to evolve, there must be genetic variation
	- inherited through genes w/in population
### More Offspring are produced than survive
- fish can lay hundreds of eggs per mating, but only a fraction will survive and reproduce
- all organisms face events that cause serious injury

### Competition
- all organisms struggle to survive
- finite resources
- organisms fight and compete for those resources

### Differential Reproductive Success
- different rates at which species can reproduce successfully
- inherited adaptations can be beneficial in helping them win competition
- some organisms will be able to survive tough conditions compared to others, and these survivors will go on to reproduce

|**Condition of natural selection**|**How it is modeled in the simulation**|**How it affects population size and makeup**|
|Genetic variation|Different alleles for color of fur, floppiness of ears, type of teeth|rabbits have different colors of fur, and different teeth, depending on what kind of food is available|
|More offspring are produced than can survive|overpopulation during times of less food in the area|those who can't eat what is available or what they are unable to eat die|
|Competition|large numbers of bunnies competing for the amount of food available|no more food left for some bunnies, they die|
|Differential reproductive success|wolves eat some of the bunnies|wolves eat some, population decreases|
