- **Homologies**: similarities among organisms
	- observed in anatomy, embryos, and molecules
- **Homologous Structures:** structures on different organisms that are similar in position, structure, and evolutionary origin
	- used to suggest that organisms that possess homologous structures share common ancestor
	- product of **divergent evolution**
		- one species evolves/diverges into 2+ species as a result of different environments/selective pressures
		- possess many similar structures b/c they came from common ancestor

#### Homologous Embryos
- embryos of most vertebrates structured very similarly
	- all look similar as embryos and possess similar characteristics like a post-anal tail, etc
		- in fish, pharyngeal gill slits become gills, for land organisms - structure assoc. w/ ears

#### Molecular Homologies
- can be found in molecular level in DNA
- Similarities can suggest that they are closely related and possibly desc. from common ancestor.
- all organisms have DNA made of the same components


- **Analogous Structure**: opposite of homologous structure; provide evidence for evolution but in slightly different manner - refers to structures that perform very similar functions but are structured differently
- bats and birds share wings with similar structure, but bee wings are made of different materials, but they still allow them to fly
- organisms that don't share common ancestor can evolve similar traits to survive and reproduce
- result of **convergent evolution**: two different organisms evolve similar traits to survive
