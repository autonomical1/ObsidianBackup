- **Biodiversity**: variety of living things on Earth
- **Theory of Evolution**: Genetic makeup of populations of organisms change over time as the result of variable survival and reproduction
	- explains how modern organisms descended from ancient organisms
	- millions of years ago, dinosaurs began accumulating changes (evolved) to become better adapted to environments
- rule of evolution: individual can't evolve, only a population
	- height of humans as an example - fruit on higher areas would require need of taller height, so taller humans survive more and pass down tall gene
- **Evolution is the result of differential survival and passing on of genes**
- Originated in 1800s by **Charles Darwin**
- evidence includes: fossil record, biogeography, vestigial structures, etc.
