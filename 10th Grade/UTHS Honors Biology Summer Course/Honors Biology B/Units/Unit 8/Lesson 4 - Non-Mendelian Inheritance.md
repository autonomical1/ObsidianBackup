- Blood types in humans don't follow the Mendelian pattern of inheritance.
	- determined by a gene with 3 alleles - A, B, and O
	- the combinations of any of these alleles produce blood types: A, B, AB, and O
	- A and B alleles are both dominant
	- O allele is recessive

|Blood Genotypes|Blood Phenotypes|
|AA, AO|A|
|BB, BO|B|
|AB|AB|
|OO|O|

### Incomplete Dominance
- some plants that cross (red and white plants) can produce offspring with pink flowers since neither the red or white allele are dominant

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Phenotype|Genotype|
|Red|RR (Homozygous)|
|White|WW (Homozygous)|
|Pink|RW (Heterozygous)|

### Codominance
- both alleles can be equally expressed
- ex: multiple colors in chicken feathers

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Phenotype|Genotype|
|Red Hair|RR (Homozygous)|
|White Hair|WW (Homozygous)|
|Roan (Red and white)|RW (Heterozygous)|


### Sex-Linked Traits
- some traits can appear in one gender more than the other
	- Hemophilia is an example - occurs in both males and females, but females can be carriers since they have 2 X chromosomes.
	- Hemophilia occurs more in men, since it is a recessive trait, and they only have one X chromosome - so if they have the hemophiliac chromosome, they exhibit those traits

|---|---|
|Males|Females|
|XHY (normal)|XHXH (normal)|
|XhY (hemophilia disorder)|XHXh (carrier)|
||XhXh (hemophilia disorder)|

- Cat coloration is both sex-linked and codominant
	- orange or black
	- both genes expressed and gene is only on X chromosome
