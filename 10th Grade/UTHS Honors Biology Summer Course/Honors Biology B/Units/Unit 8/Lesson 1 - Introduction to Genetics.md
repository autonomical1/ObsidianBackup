- All organisms have a set of traits inherited from their parents
	- hair color, eye color, etc. 
	- all coded for by DNA

# Introduction to Genetics Lab

### Pre-Lab Questions
1.  Genetics is the study of the genes that make organisms what they are. Traits are specific characteristics of an organism. Genes are sections of DNA that code for specific traits. DNA is the genetic code of all organisms.
2. ![[RenderedI (27).jpg|250]]

1. Heads had the most impact on what the trait would be (since there are two traits that are based of the heads side).
2. The genotype would have to be homozygous, and both alleles would have to be the recessive allele.
3. 2


- The sequences of nitrogen bases in DNA are called genes and they determine the traits of an organism.
- expression of the trait that each gene codes for depends on:
	- Does each parent contribute the same or different gene sequence for the trait?
	- Is the gene dominant or recessive?
		- the two versions of genes are called **alleles**
		- Dominant genes are always expressed when present, recessive alleles only expressed when there are no dominant genes present.
		- Dominant alleles represented with uppercase letter, recessive with lower
- 3 possible combinations of alleles:
	- EE (homozygous dominant) - two dominant copies of gene
		- express dominant phenotype
	- ee (homozygous recessive) - two recessive copies
		- express recessive phenotype
	- Ee (heterozygous) - 1 dominant and 1 recessive gene
		- express dominant phenotype
