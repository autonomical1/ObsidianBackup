- Punnett squares show probability of the offspring of two parents with particular genotypes of having each different genotype
- each box represents a 25% chance of getting that genotype
	- this is a *monohybrid cross*

- Gregor Mendel, named the father of genetics, mated plants with other plants to see what characteristics would be passed down.
	- he mated homozygous dominant tall plants with homozygous recessive short plants - called it the P or *parent generation*
		- All of the resulting offspring were tall - called this the **F<sub>1</sub>** generation
	- Mated the F<sub>1</sub> generation, found that for every 3 tall plants, there would be a short plant

#### Genetics Performance Activity
1. 
	- Genotypes - Parent 1: LL, Parent 2: ll
	- Phenotypes - Parent 1: Tall, Parent 2: Short
2. 





- Dwarfism: 
	- rarity:
		- 1/15000 to 1/40000 chance
	- Symptoms:
		- Arms and legs are short compared to head and torso
		- larger head, weak muscles
	- complications:
		- bowed legs, arthritis, sleep apnea, hydrocephalus, weight gain
