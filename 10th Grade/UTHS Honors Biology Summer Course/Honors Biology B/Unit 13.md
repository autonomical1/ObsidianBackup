### Unit 13, Lesson 3 (HON BIO B)
1. Food webs and chains showcase predator-prey interactions, where the predators capture and feed on prey. This is important for ecosystems to maintain homeostasis, since the predators regulate the size and growth of the prey populations. There are also symbiotic interactions between species. Symbiosis means to have a close interdependent relationship between two species. The first type is mutualism, which is when both species benefit from the relationship. An example of this is when oxpecker birds land on zebra, and the birds eat parasites off the zebra. The birds benefit by getting food, and the zebra benefits by the removal of parasites. The next type is commensalism, where one species benefits, and the other is not affected. An example of this is barnacles on whales, where the barnacles are transported where they need to go to get food, and whales are not affected in any way. The final type of symbiosis is parasitism, where parasites benefit, and the host species is harmed. The parasites don't immediately kill the host, but instead harvest the nutrients from the host, harming the host in the process.
2. Symbiotic relationships are visible in almost every aspect in nature. In my backyard garden, there are bees that pollinate the flowers. The bees benefit since they receive nectar to feed themselves, and the flowers benefit since they can reproduce due to the pollination.
3. I find it really interesting how species can just create relationships with other species, just by being available and having things where someone benefits. I still find it super interesting how mutualistic relationships work, since the species just find each other and help each other out.
