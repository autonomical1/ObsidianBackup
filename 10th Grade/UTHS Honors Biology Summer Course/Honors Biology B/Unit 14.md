### Unit 14, Lesson 1 (HON BIO B)
1. Succession is the environmental process where species arrive into a habitat after it has been created or disrupted by an environmental disturbance. When an environmental disturbance occurs, all of the organisms in the area will die. After the disturbance has settled, a "pioneer species" will inhabit the environment. These pioneer species are typically the toughest species, and they can survive in very harsh environments with limited nutrients. After multiple generations of pioneer species, which replenish the soil with the nutrients needed to sustain better life, an "intermediate species" begins to inhabit the area, which are usually slightly larger plants. After multiple generations of both the pioneer and intermediate species, the climax community forms after many years, which has the maximum amount of biodiversity, similar to what was there before the disaster. There are two types of disturbances with different types of succession. During a primary succession, the inciting incident causes an environment to have very little nutrients, so there will be very little biodiversity and the pioneer species is small and can live in harsh conditions. If there is a disaster where the nutrients stay in the soil, this is a secondary succession, where the pioneer species are just smaller plants that were already present.
2. In the Australian wildfires in 2020, much of the Australian wildlife died, including animals, trees, plants, and other organisms. This area will undergo secondary succession over the course of many years. The areas that were affected will not have a large amount of biodiversity, but the pioneer species will be plants that previously inhabited that area.
3. I didn't know that there were two types of succession. I thought that in the event of a fire or flood, or even a volcanic eruption, there would be the same types of growth and biodiversity. I also didn't know that it took almost 150 years to redevelop the ecosystem to what it was before the disaster.
