**Capacitors**: Any configuration of two conductors having equal charge with opposite sign
- Q produces an electric field between the conductors
- $\Delta V$ due to electric field
- Experiment:
	- $\Delta V \propto Q$ 
- Proportionality constant: $c$
	- $Q = C \cdot \Delta V$
	- $c$ is known as capacitance of the capacitor
	- SI Unit: $[c] = F$
		- Farad
		- equivalent to: $\frac{1C}{1V}$
- **Parallel Plate Capacitor**:
	- C
