**Capacitors**: Any configuration of two conductors having equal charge with opposite sign
- Q produces an electric field between the conductors
- $\Delta V$ due to electric field
- Experiment:
	- $\Delta V \propto Q$ 
- Proportionality constant: $c$
	- $Q = C \cdot \Delta V$
	- $c$ is known as capacitance of the capacitor
	- SI Unit: $[c] = F$
		- Farad
		- equivalent to: $\frac{1C}{1V}$
- **Parallel Plate Capacitor**:
	- Conductors are plates.
	- Uniform, strong $\overrightarrow{E}$ 
	- $\overrightarrow{E} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_{O}A}$ from + to -
	- Uniform $\overrightarrow{E}$: $\Delta V = E \cdot D$
		- $E =\frac{\Delta V}{d}$ 
		- $E = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_{0}A}$
		- $Q = C\Delta V$
		- $C = \frac{\epsilon_{0}A}{d}$
