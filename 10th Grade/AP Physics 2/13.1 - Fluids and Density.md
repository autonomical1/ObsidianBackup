- **Fluid**: substance that flows
- **gas**: system where each molecule moves freely through space, until it occasionally collides with another molecule/wall of the container
	- compressible, volume is easily increased and decreased
	- liquids are nearly incompressible, just like solids

#### Density
-  ratio of mass to volume
	- **mass density**: ρ = M/V
	- m = ρV
	- Units: kg/m<sup>3</sup> 
		- g/cm<sup>3</sup> used as well
			- 1 kg/m<sup>3</sup> = 1000 g/cm<sup>3</sup>
	- independent of object's size
