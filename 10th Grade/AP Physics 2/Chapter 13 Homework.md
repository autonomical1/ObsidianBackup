	- First, using a scale or balance, find the mass of the object.
	- Then, fill an adequately sized parcel with measurements with water, and record the initial volume of the water in the container.
	- Place the unknown object inside of the parcel, and record the final volume of the water in the container.
	- Using the density equation, œÅ = m/V, plug the mass and difference of volumes in the equation, which provides you with the final density.

	- A, B and C all have the same amount of pressure being exerted on them because they are located at the same depth in the fluid, and since the pressure being exerted on an object at a specific depth is equal to the sum of the outside pressure and the product of the fluid density, depth in the liquid, and gravity.

(8)
	- D would have the most pressure being exerted on it because it has the lowest depth in the fluid
