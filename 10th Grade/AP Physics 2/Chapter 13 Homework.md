	- First, using a scale or balance, find the mass of the object.
	- Then, fill an adequately sized parcel with measurements with water, and record the initial volume of the water in the container.
	- Place the unknown object inside of the parcel, and record the final volume of the water in the container.
	- Using the density equation, œÅ = m/V, plug the mass and difference of volumes in the equation, which provides you with the final density.

	- A, B and C all have the same amount of pressure being exerted on them because they are located at the same depth in the fluid, and since the pressure being exerted on an object at a specific depth is equal to the sum of the outside pressure and the product of the fluid density, depth in the liquid, and gravity.

(8)
	- D would have the most pressure being exerted on it because it has the lowest depth in the fluid.
	- F would have the 2nd most pressure since it is below the max height of the liquid, but still under D.
	- E would have the least pressure because it is at the highest point of the fluid.

(15)
	- A would have be the most dense because it displaces more water compared to its weight
	- C would be the 2nd most dense object in the liquid because it displaces half of its weight before having 0 net force being exerted on it. 
	- B would be the least dense of the 3 boxes because it displaces the least amount of fluid.

(24)
	- Both beakers weigh the same. This is because in Beaker A, the water weighs however much the volume divided by the density is. In Beaker B, the sphere would displace the same amount of liquid as its weight as known from Archemedes' Principle, so the water without the sphere may not reach the same height, because it doesn't have the weight of the object displacing some of it.
