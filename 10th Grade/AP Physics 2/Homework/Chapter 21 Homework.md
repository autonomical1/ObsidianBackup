	a) Since $W = -q\Delta V$, and there is no change in $\Delta V$, there is no change in work.
	b) There is no change in electric potential energy, because there is no work on either of 
	c) The speed at both i and f would be equal because there is no work done, so there is no change in kinetic energy, so no change in velocity.
