	a) Since $W = -q\Delta V$, and there is no change in $\Delta V$, there is no change in work.
	b) There is no change in electric potential energy, because there is no work on either of 
	c) The speed at both i and f would be equal because there is no work done, so there is no change in kinetic energy, so no change in velocity.
	d) Yes, they are consistent, because there is no change in electric potential. 
7)
	a) They are both the same because the change in electric field is the same between $\Delta V_{1->2}$ and $\Delta V_{1->3}$ 
	b) $v_{2}$ and $v_{3}$ is the same and $v_{1}$ is the smallest, because the acceleration of the charge is lower than points 2 and 3. Since 2 and 3 are closest to the negative plate, they have already been accelerated to a higher velocity than point 1. 
9)
	a) The ratio is $\frac{3}{1}$ because the electric potential is proportional to the distance from the negative plate. 
	b) The ratio is $\frac{1}{3}$, because the electric field is inversely proportional to the distance from the plate.
