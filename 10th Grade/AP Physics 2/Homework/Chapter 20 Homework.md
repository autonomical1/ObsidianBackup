	A) The glass rod will be attracted to the object, because silk takes away the electrons from the rod, so it becomes positively charged.
	B) If the plastic rod is attracted to the object, the glass rod will be repelled by the object because it is positively charged.
6)
	The first sphere will have a total of 3 charges (+, -, -), and the second sphere will have a total of 3 charges, (+, -, -). This is because the charges must balance, and since there is 4 negative charges, the 2 positive charges must be split between both spheres for the spheres to be electrically neutral.
11)
	The sphere will be neutral because when the positively charged rod is brought close to the metal rod A, the electrons will move from the side touching the sphere to the side closest to the + rod. This means that the protons move closer to the metal sphere (since like charges repel). Since there are protons close to the sphere, the electrons in the sphere will move closer to the rod, and the protons in the sphere will move away from it. When the positively charged rod is moved away from the metal rod A, all of the charges move a
