	A) The glass rod will be attracted to the object, because silk takes away the electrons from the rod, so it becomes positively charged.
	B) If the plastic rod is attracted to the object, the glass rod will be repelled by the object because it is positively charged.

	--The first sphere will have a total of 3 charges (+, -, -), and the second sphere will have a total of 3 charges, (+, -, -). This is because the charges must balance, and since there is 4 negative charges, the 2 positive charges must be split between both spheres for the spheres to be electrically neutral.--

	Each sphere ends up with one unit of negative charge. once they touch, the two spheres essentially become one conductor. Overall Net charge = -2, and charge is spread uniformly over the surface of a conductor, so each sphere ends up with -1.
11)
	--The sphere will be neutral because when the positively charged rod is brought close to the metal rod A, the electrons will move from the side touching the sphere to the side closest to the + rod. This means that the protons move closer to the metal sphere (since like charges repel). Since there are protons close to the sphere, the electrons in the sphere will move closer to the rod, and the protons in the sphere will move away from it. When the positively charged rod is moved away from the metal rod A, all of the charges move back to their initial positions.--

	The charge is free to move throughout the rod sphere combination. Negative charges move into rod A towards the + rod, so the sphere becomes positively charged.

	The electric field inside the straw will be 0, because the electric forces all around the straw cancel out.

	a) 3$\overrightarrow{E}_1$
	b) 3$\overrightarrow{E}_1$
	c) 4$\overrightarrow{E}_1$
	d) -4$\overrightarrow{E}_1$

	a) Yes. It is closer to the 10 nC charge.
	b) Yes. It is closer to the -20 nC charge.
23)
	B. This is because both of the charges are positive, so the net dipole of both of the charges is larger than a dipole with a positive and negative charge.

	- $$F_{E}= k_{E}\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$$
	- $$q_{1} = 7.5 nC = 9\times10^{-9} C$$
	- $$q_{2} = -2.0 nC = -2\times10^{-9} C$$
	- $$r = 1.5 cm = 0.015m$$
	- $$F_{E}= (9.0\times10^{9}\frac{N\times m^2}{C^{2}})\frac{(9\times10^{-9}C)(-2\times10^{-9}C)}{(0.015 m)^{2}}$$
	- $$F_{E}= -7.2\times10^{-4} \frac{N\times C}{m^2} $$
29)
	A. It will rotate in a clockwise direction because even though the dipole is electrically neutral, they still have an electric field due to the charges being separated. Since like charges repel and opposite charges attract, the + charge will move to the right, and the - charge will move to the left, resulting in a clockwise movement.

	a) Electrons were transferred between the rod and the sphere. They went from the sphere to the rod, because the rod's total electric charge went down. 
	b) Since $1 C = 6.24\times10^{18} e^-$, and the total transfer of electric charge is 4 C, there were $2.496\times10^{19}$ $e^-$ transferred.

	There will also be no net electric force on $q_1$ because it has the same magnitude and same charge as $q_2$.
