	- First, using a scale or balance, find the mass of the object.
	- Then, fill an adequately sized parcel with measurements with water, and record the initial volume of the water in the container.
	- Place the unknown object inside of the parcel, and record the final volume of the water in the container.
	- Using the density equation, œÅ = m/V, plug the mass and difference of volumes in the equation, which provides you with the final density.

(7)
	- A, B and C all have the same amount of pressure being exerted on them because they are located at the same depth in the fluid, and since the pressure being exerted on an object at a specific depth is equal to the sum of the outside pressure and the product of the fluid density, depth in the liquid, and gravity.

(8)
	- D would have the most pressure being exerted on it because it has the lowest depth in the fluid.
	- F would have the 2nd most pressure since it is below the max height of the liquid, but still under D.
	- E would have the least pressure because it is at the highest point of the fluid.

(15)
	- A would have be the most dense because it displaces more water compared to its weight
	- C would be the 2nd most dense object in the liquid because it displaces half of its weight before having 0 net force being exerted on it. 
	- B would be the least dense of the 3 boxes because it displaces the least amount of fluid.

	- Both beakers weigh the same. This is because in Beaker A, the water weighs however much the volume divided by the density is. In Beaker B, the sphere would displace the same amount of liquid as its weight as known from Archemedes' Principle, so the water without the sphere may not reach the same height, because it doesn't have the weight of the object displacing some of it. 

(27)
	- I would rank the speeds of the gas at the highest being at 3, then the 2nd highest being at 1, and the slowest being at 2. This is because when fluids move at a high speed, the pressure decreases, and when fluids move at a low speed, the pressure increases. These tubes are also known as Ventari tubes which show the speeds of fluids based on how much they flow. Since the tube at point 2 is the highest, it must have the most pressure, which means that it must have the least speed.

29.
	- 1, 3, 2, 4
	- (a) This is because speed is the largest when the tube is at its narrowest. Since 1 is the most narrow, and 4 is the widest, their speeds also correlate.
	- (b) Since pressure is inversely proportional to speed, as speed decreases, pressure increases, so the slowest point would have the most pressure, and the fastest point would have the least pressure. This would result in 4 having the most pressure, then 2, then 3, then 1.

	- There is air flow through the house. Since the wind is above the house (specifically above the chimney), the speed of the air would send some down the chimney, which would make its way throughout the house, and move the rest of the air out of the window.

33.
	- C. This is because even though the densities are the different, the masses are the same, so both blocks displace the same amount of water.
34.
	 - C.

36.
	- B

37.
	- C

	- 1 mL = 1g
	- 200 mL H2O = 200 g H2O
	- 200 g H2O + 150 g = 350 g
	- 512 g - 350 g = 162 g
	- **162 mL**
