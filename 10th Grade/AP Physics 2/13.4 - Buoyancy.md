# Buoyancy
- **buoyant force**: upward force of a fluid on an object
	- _Ex_: force that pushes up on an air mattress on top of a swimming pool

		- The pressure in a liquid increases with depth, so when the bottom of the cylinder inside the water is lower than the top of the cylinder, the force exerted by the pressure on the bottom of the cylinder is more than the force exerted on the the top, so a net force is created
			- This pressure exerts a *net upward force* on a submerged object: F<sub>net</sub> = F<sub>up</sub> - F<sub>down</sub>
- If an isolated box of a fluid is in static equilibrium, then the box's weight force pulling it down must be balanced by an upward force (buoyant force)
	- This matches the weight of the fluid
	- If the box is replaced with an object with the same size and shape, the buoyant force is exactly the same as before

- **Displaced fluid**: When an object is immersed in a liquid, it *displaces* the liquid around it by the same amount of volume it takes up
- ***Archemedes' Principle: A fluid exerts an upward buoyant force F<sub>B</sub> on an object immersed in or floating in the fluid. The magnitude of the force is equal to the weight of the fluid immersed in the object.
	- in equation form: F<sub>B</sub> = ρ<sub>f</sub>V<sub>f</sub>g
		- ρ<sub>f</sub> = density of fluid 
		- V<sub>f</sub> = volume of fluid
		- g = gravity

# Float or Sink
- When holding an object underwater, if it sinks, floats, or stays in the same position depends on if the upwards buoyant force is more/less/equal to the downward weight force of the object
- magnitude of buoyant force:  ρ<sub>f</sub>V<sub>f</sub>g
- However, compound objects like a scuba diver, may have differing amounts of density
	- **average density**: ρ<sub>avg</sub> = m<sub>o</sub>/V<sub>o</sub> 
	- weight of compound object: F<sub>g, o</sub> = ρ<sub>avg</sub>V<sub>o</sub>g
- Objects will float or sink depending on whether the fluid density is larger or smaller than the average density of the object
	- If densities are equal, the object is in static equillibrium, and it remains motionless (**neutral buoyancy**)

# Boats and Balloons
- A steel-hulled boat will float because it has a really hollow shell, which allows it to displace the same amount of water that will allow it to sink until the boat displaces the same amount of water that it weighs
- floation and buoyancy applies to all fluids
	- air also has buoyant forces acted on it, but since the density of air is so low, it ends up being negligible
