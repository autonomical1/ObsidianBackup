- **buoyant force**: upward force of a fluid on an object
	- _Ex_: force that pushes up on an air mattress on top of a swimming pool

		- Since the bottom of the cylinder inside the water is lower than the top of the cylinder, the force exerted by the pressure on the bottom of the cylinder is more than the force exerted on the the top, so a net force is created
- **Displaced fluid**: When an object is immersed in a liquid, it *displaces* the liquid around it by the same amount of volume it takes up
- ***Archemedes' Principle: A fluid exerts an upward buoyant force F<sub>B</sub> on an object immersed in or floating in the fluid. The magnitude of the force is equal to the weight of the fluid immersed in the object.
	- in equation form: F<sub>B</sub> = œÅ<sub>f</sub>V<sub>f</sub>g
