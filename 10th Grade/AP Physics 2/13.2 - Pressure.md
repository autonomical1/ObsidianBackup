- Liquids also exert forces on the walls of their containers, where a force F due to the liquid pushes on a wall with an area A
	- P = F/A
	- SI unit of pressure: pascal
		- 1 pascal = 1 Pa = 1 N/m<sup>2</sup>
- force due to a liquid's pressure is not just on the walls of the container, but all parts of the liquid as well

	- analogous to tension being in all parts of a string, pressure is exerted on all parts of a fluid body
### Pressure in Liquids
- the force of gravity is the source of the pressure exerted by a fluid
- pressure increases with depth in a liquid because the liquid below is being squeezed by the liquid above
- P = P<sub>0</sub> + ρgd
	- **hydrostatic pressure**: pressure of a liquid with a density ρ and depth d
		- g denotes that it is the origin of the pressure

- Since the pressure at the bottom of the narrow tube is higher than the wide tube, the difference in pressure would make the liquid move from the right tube to the left, until the levels are equal (equillibrium is reached)
- **A connected liquid in hydrostatic equilibrium rises to the same height in all open regions of the container**
- **In hydrostatic equilibrium, the pressure is the same at all points on a horizontal line through a connected liquid of a single kind.**

### Atmospheric Pressure
- global average sea-level pressure, the standard atmosphere, is l atrn = 101,300 Pa
- Atmospheric pressure varies not only with altitude, but also with changes in the weather.
