- Liquids also exert forces on the walls of their containers, where a force F due to the liquid pushes on a wall with an area A
	- P = F/A
	- SI unit of pressure: pascal
		- 1 pascal = 1 Pa = 1 N/m<sup>2</sup>
- force due to a liquid's pressure is not just on the walls of the container, but all parts of the liquid as well

	- analogous to tension being in all parts of a string, pressure is exerted on all parts of a fluid body
### Pressure in Liquids
- the force of gravity is the source of the pressure exerted by a fluid
- pressure increases with depth in a liquid because the liquid below is being squeezed by the liquid above
- P = P<sub>0</sub> + œÅgd
	- **hydrostatic pressure**:
