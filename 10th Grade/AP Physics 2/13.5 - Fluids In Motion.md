- To avoid difficulties in modeling fluid dynamics, a simplified model of an ideal fluid is used:
	- 1. The fluid must be *incompressible*. 
	- 2. The flow of the fluid is *steady*.
		- **laminar flow**: when fluid velocity does not change at any part across the fluid
			- compared to turbulent flow
	- 3. The fluid is *nonviscous*
