### The Form of Magnetic Force on a Current
- We learned that the magnetic field exerts no force on a charged particle moving parallel to a magnetic field.
- If a current-carrying wire is parallel to a magnetic field, the force is also zero.
- The length of the wire *L*, the current *I*, and the magnetic field *B* affect the magnitude of the force on the wire:$$F_{wire} = ILB \cdot \sin \alpha$$
- When the wire is perpendicular to the field, $\alpha = 90 \deg$ so:
		$$F_{wire} = ILB$$
### Forces Between Currents
- Because a current produced a magnetic field, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current, it follows that two current-carrying wires will exert forces on each other.
- A wire carrying a current $I_1$ will create a magnetic field $\overrightarrow{B_{1}}$ 
- A second wire with current $I_{2}$ will experience the magnetic force due to the wire with current $I_{1}$.
- Using the right-hand rule for forces, we can see that when $I_{2}$ is in the same direction as $I_{1}$, the second wire is attracted to the first one.
- If they were in opposite directions, the second wire would be repelled. 
### Forces between Current Loops
- Just as there is an attractive force between parallel wires that have currents in the same direction, there is an attractive force between parallel loops in the same direction.
- There is a repulsive force between parallel loops with currents in opposite directions.
- Current loop, like a bar magnet, is a magnetic dipole.
