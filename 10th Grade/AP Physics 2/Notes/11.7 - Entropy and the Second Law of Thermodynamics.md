# Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics
- Spontaneous transfer of heat from hot to cold is an *irreversable* process (one direction)
- **Second Law of Thermodynamics:** prevents transfer of heat from cold to hot

# Reversable and Irreversable Processes
- @ microscopic level, collisions between molecules are reversable
