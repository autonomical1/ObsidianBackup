# Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics
- Spontaneous transfer of heat from hot to cold is an *irreversable* process (one direction)
- **Second Law of Thermodynamics:** prevents transfer of heat from cold to hot

# Reversable and Irreversable Processes
- @ microscopic level, collisions between molecules are reversable

- @ macroscopic level, collisions are usually irreversable

# Which Way to Equilibrium
- If box 1 has more balls than box 2, and you randomly pick any ball to switch boxes, there is a higher probability you will pick a ball from box 1
	- Net flow of balls moving from box 1 to box 2 until equilibrium is reached.

- Although each transfer is reversable, **the statistics of large numbers make it overwhelmingly likely that the system will evolve toward a state where N<sub>1</sub> ~ N<sub>2</sub>
- system reaches thermal equilibrium not because it is a plan, but because **equilibrium is the most probable state to be**

# Order, Disorder, and Entropy
- **Entropy:** quantifies the probability that a certain state of a system will occur
- **Entropy increases as 2 systems with initially different temps. move toward thermal equilibrium**
