# Entropy and the Second Law of Thermodynamics
- Spontaneous transfer of heat from hot to cold is an *irreversable* process (one direction)
- **Second Law of Thermodynamics:** prevents transfer of heat from cold to hot

# Reversable and Irreversable Processes
- @ microscopic level, collisions between molecules are reversable

# Which Way to Equilibrium
- If box 1 has more balls than box 2, and you randomly pick any ball to switch boxes, there is a higher probability you
