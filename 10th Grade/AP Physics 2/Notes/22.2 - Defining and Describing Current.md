**Electric Current**: 
- Consists of charges flowing through some region of space
- Analogous to water flowing through a pipe

**Definition of Current (I)**:
- $I = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$
- SI unit: Ampere (amp)
	- 1 Amp = $\frac{1C}{1S}$
- Conductor: some charge may freely flow.
	- Metals -> outer most electrons are loosely bound.
		- "Conduction electrons"
- **Conventional Current**: Flows in the direction of positive charges

**Conservation of Current at a Junction**:
- **junction**: point where wire branches
- total charge in must be total charge out
- $\sum I_{in} = \sum I_{out}$
- **Kirchhoff's Junction Law**: the sum of the currents into the junction equals the sum of the currents leaving
