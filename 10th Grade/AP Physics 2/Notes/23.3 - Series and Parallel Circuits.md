- **Series circuit**: if circuit elements are connected directly to each other with no junction in between
- **Parallel circuit**: if circuit elements are not connected directly to each other and have a junction in between
	- Current will divide due to Kirchhoff's Junction Rule

**Series Resistors**:
- When there are two resistors in series, the current must be the same in both resistors because there are no junctions in the circuit
- Kirchhoff's Loop Rule shows potential differences:
	- $$\sum\limits \Delta V_{i} = \epsilon + \Delta V_{1} + \Delta V_{2} = 0$$
- An easy way to model multiple resistors in series is creating an equivalent resistor:
	- $$R_{eq} = R_{1} + R_{2} + . . . + R_{n}$$

**Parallel Resistors**:
- The potential differences across each resistor in parallel is equal to the  emf of the battery because both resistors are connected directly to the battery 
- The current $I_{bat}$ from the battery splits into currents $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$ at the top of the junction
- Junction law states $$I_{bat}= I_{1} + I_{2}$$
- $$I_{bat} = \epsilon (\frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{r_{2}})$$
- $$R_{eq} =  \frac{\Delta V}{I} = \frac{\epsilon}{I_{bat}} = (\frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}})^{-1}$$
- $$R_{eq} = (\frac{1}{R_{1}} + \frac{1}{R_{2}} + . . . + \frac{1}{R_{n}})^{-1} $$
	- DO NOT FORGET TO TAKE RECIPROCAL OF THE TOTAL RESISTANCES
- *The equivalent resistance of several resistors in parallel is always less than any single resistor in the group**
