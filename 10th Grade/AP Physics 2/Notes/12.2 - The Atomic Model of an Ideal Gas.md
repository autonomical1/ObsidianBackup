# The Atomic Model of an Ideal Gas
- The temperature of an ideal gas is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy per atom K<sub>avg</sub>:
	-  T = (2/3)(K<sub>avg</sub>/k<sub>B</sub>)
		-  k<sub>B</sub> - **Boltzmann's Constant**
			-  k<sub>B</sub> = 1.38 * 10<sup>-23</sup> J/K
				- Joules/Kelvin

- The thermal energy of an ideal gas containing N atoms is the sum of the kinetic energies of the individual atoms: 
	- E<sub>th</sub> = NK<sub>avg</sub> = 3/2 (Nk<sub>B</sub>T)
	- For an ideal gas, **thermal energy is directly proportional to temperature:**
		- ΔE<sub>th</sub> = 3/2 (Nk<sub>B</sub>ΔT)
		- K ∝ T

# Molecular Speeds and Temperature
- V<sub>rms</sub> = √(3k<sub>B</sub>T/m)
	- Temperature must be in Kelvin

# From Collisions to Pressure and the Ideal-Gas Law
- Pressure should be proportional to the temperature of the gas: P ∝ T
- Pressure should be inversely proportional to the volume of the container: P ∝ 1/V
- Pressure should be proportional to the number of gas particles: P ∝ N

	- PV = Nk
