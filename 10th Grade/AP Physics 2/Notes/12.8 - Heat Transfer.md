# Conduction
- **Conduction**: transfer of thermal energy directly through a physical material
- ![[Pasted image 20220918163346.png]]
- **thermal conductivity**: W/m * K 
- ![[Pasted image 20220918163420.png]]
- good conductors of electricity are also good conductors of heat

# Convection
- **Convection**: transfer of thermal energy by motion of a fluid
- faster moving atoms transfer E<sub>th</sub> to adjacent atoms
- reason for wind systems and ocean currents

# Radiation
- **radiation**: consists of EM waves that are visible throug infrared
- energy radiated by an object dependent on T

	- e = **emissivity** of a surface
	- T = abs. temp. in K
	- A = surface area in m<sup>2</sup>
