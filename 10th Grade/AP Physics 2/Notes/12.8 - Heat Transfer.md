# Conduction
- **Conduction**: transfer of thermal energy directly through a physical material

- **thermal conductivity**: W/m * K

- good conductors of electricity are also good conductors of heat

# Convection
- **Convection**: transfer of thermal energy by motion of a fluid
- faster moving atoms transfer E<sub>th</sub> to adjacent atoms
- reason for wind systems and ocean currents

# Radiation
- **radiation**: consists of EM waves that are visible
