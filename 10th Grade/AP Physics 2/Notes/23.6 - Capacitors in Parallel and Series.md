- parallel capacitors can be represented by a single **equivalent capacitance**
- Total charge on two capacitors in a parallel circuit: $$Q = Q_{1} + Q_{2} = C_{1} \Delta V_{c} + C_{2} \Delta V_{c} = (C_{1} + C_{2}) \Delta V_{c}$$
- Potential differences across 2 capacitors in series are: $$\Delta V_{1} = \frac{Q}{C_{1}}$$ and $$\Delta V_{2} = \frac{Q}{C_{2}}$$
- Total potential difference: $$\Delta V_{c} = \Delta V_{1} + \Delta V_{2}$$
- Total capacitance in a series circuit is:$$\frac{1}{C_{eq}} = \frac{1}{C_{1}} + \frac{1}{C_{2}}$$
