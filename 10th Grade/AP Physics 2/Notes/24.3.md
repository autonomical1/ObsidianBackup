### Electric Currents also create Magnetic Fields
- Compass with react to the presence of a bar magnet
	- will also deflect if you place the compass near a wire and pass a current through the wire. 
- Magnetic field lines form circles around the wire. Magnetic force strength decreases as distance from wire increases.

- Magnetic field lines curve through the center of the look and back through the loop's center, forming complete closed curves. The field lines far from loop look like field lines from a bar magnet.

- Magnetic field lines due to currents have no start or end, they  form complete closed curves
- Ordinary magnets are often called permanent magnets to distinguish between electromagnets.
