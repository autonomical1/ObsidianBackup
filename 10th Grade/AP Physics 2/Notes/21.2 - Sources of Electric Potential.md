**Sources of Potential:**
- Consider an uncharged capacitor:
	- $\overrightarrow{E} = 0$, so $\Delta V_{c} = E \cdot d = 0$
	- Source of $\Delta V$ is the separation of charges
	- Positive charges have positive potential
	- Negative charges have negative potential
	- $\overrightarrow{E}$ points from high to low potential
 Electric potential at position x inside a capacitor is:
	- $V = \frac{x}{d}\Delta V_{c}$
**Potential due to a Point-Charge**:
- Don't confuse V and $\overrightarrow{E}$
- $\overrightarrow{E}$ is a vector
- V is a scalar
- $|\overrightarrow{E}| \propto \frac{1}{r^{2}}$ 
- $V \propto \frac{1}{r}$
- $V(r) = k_{E} \frac{q}{r}$
- Net potential is a summation of all the charges
