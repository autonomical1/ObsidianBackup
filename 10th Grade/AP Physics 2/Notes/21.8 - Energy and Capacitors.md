**Charging a Capacitor**: 
- 2 uncharged plates, no charge, no potential difference
	- no charge = no *net* charge
	- to charge, take a positive charge from one plate and move it to the other plate
	- No Q, $\Delta V$, $\Delta U$, or $W_{ext}$
	- Total work: $W_{ext}= \sum{i} \Delta W$ 
	- Results in: 
		- $\Delta U_{c} = \frac{Q^{2}}{2C}= \frac{1}{2}C\Delta V^{2} = \frac{1}{2} Q\Delta V$
