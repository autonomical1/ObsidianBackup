**Connecting Potential and Current**:
- A battery is a source of potential difference
- current that flows through a wire connecting the battery terminals is a consequence of the potential difference
- because the ends of the wire are connected to the terminals of the battery, $\Delta V$ = $\Delta V$ between the battery terminals. 
	- $\Delta V_{wire} = \Delta V_{bat}$
- potential difference causes a current

**Resistance**:
- Current in a circuit: $I \propto \Delta V$
- Adding a second battery increases potential difference increases electric field, and therefore the current
- Increasing the length of the wire connecting the battery decreases the current, while increasing the thickness of the wire increases the current
- wires of different material will carry different currents. some materials are better conductors than others
- **Resistance**: measure of how hard it is to push charges through a wire. A large resistance implies that it is hard to move charges through the wire. The current depends on the resistance of the wire and the potential difference between the ends of the wire.

**Resistivity**:
- $\rho$ characterizes the electrical properties of materials
- Materials that are good conductors have low resistivity
- Materials that are poor conductors (good insulators) = high resistivity
- resistivity of a metal decreases with increasing temperature
- $R = \frac{\rho \cdot L}{A}$ 
	- property of a specific wire, since it depends on the conductors length, diameter and material
