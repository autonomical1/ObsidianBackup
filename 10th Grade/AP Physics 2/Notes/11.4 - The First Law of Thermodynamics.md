# The First Law of Thermodynamics
- Systems that are not moving/changing chemically, but temps can change = province of thermodynamics
- **For systems in which only the thermal energy chnages, the change in thermal energy is equal to the energy transferred into or out of the system as work W, heat Q, or both:
	- Î”E<sub>th</sub> = W + Q

# Energy-Transfer Diagrams
- **energy reservoir**: object or part of the environment so large that its temp does not noticeably change when heat is transferred b/w the system and reservoir
- Reservoir at high temp = hot res.  (T<sub>h</sub>); Low temp (T<sub>c</sub>)
- Q<sub>H</sub> and Q<sub>C</sub> are the amt. of heat transferred to/from a hot/cold res.
	- **ALWAYS POSITIVE**
