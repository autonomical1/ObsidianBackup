# The First Law of Thermodynamics
- Systems that are not moving/changing chemically, but temps can change = province of thermodynamics
- **For systems in which only the thermal energy chnages, the change in thermal energy is equal to the energy transferred into or out of the system as work W, heat Q, or both:
	- Î”E<sub>th</sub> = W + Q
