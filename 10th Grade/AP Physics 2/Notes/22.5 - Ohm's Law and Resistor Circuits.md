**Ohm's Law and Resistor Circuits**:
- $R = \frac{\Delta V_{wire}}{I}$
- Si Unit = 1 Ohm = 1 $\Omega$ = 1 $\frac{V}{A}$  
- Ohm's Law: $\Delta V = I \cdot R$ 
- Not a law of nature, not all conductors follow Ohm's Law
- Materials that follow Ohm's Law = **ohmic**
- If the graph of I vs V is linear, the material is non-ohmic, and if it is non-linear it would be non-ohmic
