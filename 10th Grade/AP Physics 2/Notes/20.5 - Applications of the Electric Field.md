**Parallel-Plate Capacitor**:
- |+++++| => |------|
	- Plate area A
	- Strong, uniform E between plates
- Charge density = η = Q/A
- |E| = η/ϵ<sub>0</sub> (Gauss's Law)
	- E = $\frac{Q}{ϵ_0A}$
		- From + plate to - plate

**Electric Field Lines**:
- Visual Representation of an Electric Field
- Rules for drawing:
	- 1. E-Field lines must begin on and emanate away from a positive charge
	- 2. E-Field lines must end on a negative charge, and they point towards the negative charge.
	- 3. If charges are not balanced, some lines will extend to infinity
	- 4. The number of lines ∝ magnitude of charge
	- 5. E-field lines cannot touch or cross.
