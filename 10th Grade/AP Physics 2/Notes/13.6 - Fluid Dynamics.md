# Fluid Dynamics
- A fluid element changes velocity as it moves from a wider to a narrower part of a tube
- fluid acc. must be caused by a force
	- high speed = low pressure; low speed = high pressure
- fluid element is pushed from both ends by the surrounding fluid (pressure forces)
- To accelerate the fluid element, the pressure must be higher on the wider part of the tube
- **pressure gradient**: region that the pressure at one point in a fluid is different to another point in the fluid
- ***An ideal fluid accelerates whenever there is a pressure gradient**

- **Bernoulli Effect**: The pressure is higher at a point along a stream line where the fluid is moving slower, lower where the fluid is moving faster
- speed of a fluid can be measured by a *venturi tube*

# Applications of the Bernoulli Effect
- As air moves over a hill, the streamlnies bunch together so the air speeds up ==> there must be a low pressure zone at the top of the hill

- *Lift*: Upward force on the wing of an airplane that makes flight possible
- wing is designed to generate lift when air speed increases and pressure is low, and vice versa
- high pressure below wthe wing pushes more strongly than the low pressure from above, causing lift

# Bernoulli's Equation
- There is a numerical relationship with pressure, height and speed of a fluid by appling Conservation of Energy
	- W = ΔK + ΔU
- The system moves out of cylindrical vol. V<sub>1</sub> into V<sub>2</sub>
	- Change in Kinetic Energy:
		- K<sub>1</sub> = 1/2ρΔVv<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> and K<sub>2</sub> = 1/2ρΔVv<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>
- Change in GPE:
	- ΔU = U<sub>2</sub> - U<sub>1</sub> = ρΔVgy<sub>2</sub> - ρΔVgy<sub>1</sub>
- +/- work:
	- W<sub>1</sub> = F<sub>1</sub>Δx<sub>1</sub> = (P<sub>1</sub>A<sub>1</sub>)Δx<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>1</sub>(A<sub>1</sub>Δx<sub>1</sub>) = P<sub>1</sub>ΔV
	- W<sub>2</sub> = F<sub>2</sub>Δx<sub>2</sub> = (P<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>)Δx<sub>2</sub> = P<sub>2</sub>(A<sub>2</sub>Δx<sub>2</sub>) = P<sub>2</sub>ΔV
