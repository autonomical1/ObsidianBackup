# Fluid Dynamics
- A fluid element changes velocity as it moves from a wider to a narrower part of a tube
- fluid acc. must be caused by a force
	- high speed = low pressure; low speed = high pressure
- fluid element is pushed from both ends by the surrounding fluid (pressure forces)
- To accelerate the fluid element, the pressure must be higher on the wider part of the tube
- **pressure gradient**: region that the pressure at one point in a fluid is different to another point in the fluid
- ***An ideal fluid accelerates whenever there is a pressure gradient**

- **Bernoulli Effect**: The pressure is higher at a point along a stream line where the fluid is moving slower, lower where the fluid is moving faster
- speed of a fluid can be measured by a *venturi tube*

# Applications of the Bernoulli Effect
- As air moves over a hill, the streamlnies bunch together so the air speeds up ==> there must be a low pressure zone at the top of the hill
