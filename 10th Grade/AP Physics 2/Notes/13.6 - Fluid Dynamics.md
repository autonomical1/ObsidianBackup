# Fluid Dynamics
- A fluid element changes velocity as it moves from a wider to a narrower part of a tube
- 
- To accelerate the fluid element, the pressure must be higher on the wider part of the tube
- **pressure gradient**: region that the pressure at one point in a fluid is different to another point in the fluid
- ***An ideal fluid accelerates whenever there is a pressure gradient**
