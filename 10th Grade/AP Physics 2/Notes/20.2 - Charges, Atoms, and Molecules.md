**Atomic View of Charging**
- No other sources of charge
- an object is charged if it has an unequal number of electrons and protons
- ionization

**SI Unit of Charge**:
	- Coulomb (c) = 1c = 6.25 * 10<sup>18</sup> e
	- e = 1.6 * 10<sup>-19</sup> C
- 3 types of materials:
	- 1. Conductors
		- metallic 
		- some charges may move freely
		- fewer than 4 electrons in outer shell
	- 2. Insulators
		- non-metallic
		- charge cannot move freely
		- 5+ electrons in outer shell
	- 3. semiconductors (not in AP2)
		- metalloids
		- C, Si, Ge,...
