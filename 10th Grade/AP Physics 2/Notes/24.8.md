### Ferromagnetism
- Materials that are strongly attracted to a magnet and that can be magnetized is called **ferromagnetic**
- Magnetism, at an atomic level, is due to the *inherent magnetic moment* of electrons.
- In most atoms with many electrons, the electrons occur in pairs with magnetic moments in opposite directions.
- Unpaired electrons are able to give an atom a net magnetic moment.
- For most elements whose atoms have magnetic moments, the moments are randomly arranged when the atoms join together to form a solid, so there is no net magnetism.
### Induced Magnetic Moments
- Ferromagnetic materials can get temporary alignments of fields. 
- HDDs work by changing the lengths of the magnets in the disks.
### Induced Currents
- We now know that a current can create a magnetic field.
- Michael Faraday experimented with two coils of wire wrapped around an iron ring in an attempt to generate a current from a magnetic field
- **Changing magnetic fields create current**
- Faraday placed one coil directly above the other, without the iron ring
	- there was no current in the lower circuit in the closed position, there was a momentary induced current
- Faraday found that there is a current in a coil of wire if an d only if the magnetic field passing through the coil is changing.
