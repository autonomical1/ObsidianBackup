# An Atomic View of Thermal Energy and Temperature
- **The thermal energy of an ideal gas is equal to the total ckinetic energy of the moving atoms in the gas**

- Gas + heat = atoms move faster = thermal energy increase
	- causes inc. in temp.
- **Temperature of an ideal gas = measure of average kinetic energy of the atoms that make up the gas**
