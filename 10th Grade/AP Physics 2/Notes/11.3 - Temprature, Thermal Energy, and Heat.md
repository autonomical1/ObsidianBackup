# An Atomic View of Thermal Energy and Temperature
- **The thermal energy of an ideal gas is equal to the total ckinetic energy of the moving atoms in the gas**
	- ![[Pasted image 20220830145433.png]]
- Gas + heat = atoms move faster = thermal energy increase
	- causes inc. in temp.
- **Temperature of an ideal gas = measure of average kinetic energy of the atoms that make up the gas**

# Temperature Scales
- For *Kelvin* scale, 0° = point where KE of all atoms = 0
- KE is always positive, so 0 = absolute
- All temps. on Kelvin scale is positive so it is often considered an *absolute temp. scale*
- Units: Kelvin (K)
	- NO DEGREES
- Absolute Zero = -273° C
