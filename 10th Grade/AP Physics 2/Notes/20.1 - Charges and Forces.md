- **Electrostatics**: electric charges that do not move
- **Electric Charge**: 2 types
	- Benjamin Franklin named them *positive* and *negative*
- Basic charge carriers:
	- Electron: - (negative)
	- Proton: + (positive)
	- Neutron: 0 (neutral)
- Matter is overwhelmingly ***neutral*** (electrically)
	- Contains a lot of charge, but has a balanced number of protons and electrons
- Electrification involves transfer of charge from one object to another.
- **Conservation of charge**: cannot be created or destroyed
