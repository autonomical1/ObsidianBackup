- **Electrostatics**: electric charges that do not move
- **Electric Charge**: 2 types
	- Benjamin Franklin named them *positive* and *negative*
- Basic charge carriers:
	- Electron: - (negative)
	- Proton: + (positive)
	- Neutron: 0 (neutral)
- Matter is overwhelmingly ***neutral*** (electrically)
	- Contains a lot of charge, but has a balanced number of protons and electrons
- Electrification involves transfer of charge from one object to another.
- **Conservation of charge**: cannot be created or destroyed, it is transferred from one object to another.
- Charging an object:
	- 1) Friction: rubbing 2 objects together
		- Ex: Amber/cloth or rubber/wool
	- 2) Conduction: Transfer of charge via contact
		- Rubber rod and metal sphere
	- 3) Induction: 
		- Polarize the object.
		- Connect the sphere to ground.
			- This forces 0 electric potential or balanced/neutral charges.
- **Electric Polarization**:

- **Electrostatic Forces**:
	- Electric charges exert forces on each other
	- Like charges repel (++ or --), opposing charges attract (+- or -+)
- **Quantization of charge**:
	- any electric charge (Q or q) must be equal to some integer by the fundamental unit of charge
		- q = Ne
			- e = fundamental unit of charge
				- Proton = Q<sub>p</sub> = +e
				- Electron = Q<sub>e</sub> = -e

- **SI Unit of Charge**:
	- Coulomb (c) = 1c = 6.25 * 10<sup>18</sup> e
	- e = 1.6 * 10<sup>-19</sup> C
- 3 types of materials:
	- 1. Conductors
		- metallic 
		- some charges may move freely
		- fewer than 4 electrons in outer shell
	- 2. Insulators
		- non-metallic
		- charge cannot move freely
		- 5+ electrons in outer shell
	- 3. semiconductors (not in AP2)
		- metalloids
		- C, Si, Ge,...

- **Electric Dipoles**
	- 2 charges of equal magnitude and opposite sign
- **Coulomb's Law**: describes the electric force between 2 charges
	- electostatic force between 2 point charges:
		- F<sub>E</sub> = k<sub>E</sub> $\frac{q1q2}{r^2}$
		- Direction of force along the line segment connecting charges
		- like charges, force is repellent
		- opposite charges, force is attractive
		- if there are more than 2 charges. use the principle of superposition:
			- determine the force as a vector for each charge pair, then add as vectors

**Electric Field**: 
- Recall that electric charges exert forces on one another
- Consider a very large source charge, and a small test charge
- Magnitude of F<sub>E</sub> from Coulomb's law:
	- F<sub>E</sub> = k<sub>E</sub> $\frac{q1q2}{r^2}$
- Define electric field, E, in terms of the force on the test charge
	- E = $\frac{Fe}{q0}$
	- |E| ∝ |F<sub>E</sub>|
	- For a positive test charge, E and F<sub>E</sub> have the same direction
	- SI Units: N/C
	- E due to the point charge
		- Then E = k<sub>E</sub> $\frac{Q}{r^2}$

**Electric Field Lines**:
- Visual Representation of an Electric Field
- Rules for drawing:
	- 1. E-Field lines must begin on and emanate away from a positive charge
	- 2. E-Field lines must end on a negative charge, and they point towards the negative charge.
	- 3. If charges are not balanced, some lines will extend to infinity
	- 4. The number of lines ∝ magnitude of charge
	- 5. E-field lines cannot touch or cross. 

**Parallel-Plate Capacitor**:
- Charge density = Q/A
