- **Electrostatics**: electric charges that do not move
- **Electric Charge**: 2 types
	- Benjamin Franklin named them *positive* and *negative*
- Basic charge carriers:
	- Electron: - (negative)
	- Proton: + (positive)
	- Neutron: 0 (neutral)
- Matter is overwhelmingly ***neutral*** (electrically)
	- Contains a lot of charge, but has a balanced number of protons and electrons
- Electrification involves transfer of charge from one object to another.
- **Conservation of charge**: cannot be created or destroyed, it is transferred from one object to another.
- Charging an object:
	- 1) Friction: rubbing 2 objects together
		- Ex: Amber/cloth or rubber/wool
	- 2) Conduction: Transfer of charge via contact
		- Rubber rod and metal sphere
	- 3) Induction: 
		- Polarize the object.
		- Connect the sphere to ground.
			- This forces 0 electric potential or balanced/neutral charges.
- **Electric Polarization**:

- **Electrostatic Forces**:
	- Electric charges exert forces on each other
	- Like charges repel (++ or --), opposing charges attract (+- or -+)
- **Quantization of charge**:
	- any electric charge (Q or q) must be equal to some integer by the fundamental unit of charge
		- q = Ne
			- e = fundamental unit of charge
				- Proton = Q<sub>p</sub> = +e
				- Electron = Q<sub>e</sub> = -e

- **SI Unit of Charge**:
	- Coulomb (c) = 1c = 6.25 * 10<sup>18</sup> e
	- e = 1.6 * 10<sup>-19</sup> C
