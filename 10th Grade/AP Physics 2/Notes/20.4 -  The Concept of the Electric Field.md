**Electric Field**: 
- Recall that electric charges exert forces on one another
- Consider a very large source charge, and a small test charge
- Magnitude of F<sub>E</sub> from Coulomb's law:
	- F<sub>E</sub> = $K_E$ $\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$
- Define electric field, E, in terms of the force on the test charge
	- $\overrightarrow{E}$ = $\frac{F_E}{q0}$
	- |$\overrightarrow{E}$| ∝ |$F_E$|
	- For a positive test charge, E and F<sub>E</sub> have the same direction
	- SI Units: N/C
	- E due to the point charge
		- Then $\overrightarrow{E}$ = $K_E$ $\frac{Q}{r^2}$

**Electric Field Lines**:
- Visual Representation of an Electric Field
- Rules for drawing:
	- 1. E-Field lines must begin on and emanate away from a positive charge
	- 2. E-Field lines must end on a negative charge, and they point towards the negative charge.
	- 3. If charges are not balanced, some lines will extend to infinity
	- 4. The number of lines ∝ magnitude of charge
	- 5. E-field lines cannot touch or cross. 
**Parallel-Plate Capacitor**:
- |+++++| => |------|
	- Plate area A
	- Strong, uniform E between plates
- Charge density = η = Q/A
- |E| = η/ϵ<sub>0</sub> (Gauss's Law)
	- E = $\frac{Q}{ϵ_0A}$
