- RC Circuits are circuits containing resistors and capacitors
- current varies with time
- values of resistance and capacitance in RC circuits determines the time it takes to charge/discharge
- At a later time in the circuit's lifespan, the current will decrease because the potential difference is decreasing
- The current and capacitor voltage decay to zero after the switch closes, but not linearly
