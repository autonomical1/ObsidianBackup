- RC Circuits are circuits containing resistors and capacitors
- current varies with time
- values of resistance and capacitance in RC circuits determines the time it takes to charge/discharge
- At a later time in the circuit's lifespan, the current will decrease because the potential difference is decreasing
- The current and capacitor voltage decay to zero after the switch closes, but not linearly
**Charging a Capacitor**:
- In a circuit that charges a capacitor, once the switch is closed, the potential difference of the battery causes a current int he circuit, and the capacitor begins to charge.
- As the capacitor charges, it develops a potential difference that opposes the current, so the current decreases, and so does the rate of charging
- The capacitor charges until $\Delta V_{c} = \epsilon$
