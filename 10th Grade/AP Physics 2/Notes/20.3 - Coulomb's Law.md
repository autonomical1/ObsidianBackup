**Coulomb's Law**: describes the electric force between 2 charges
	- electostatic force between 2 point charges:
		- $F_E = k_E$ $\frac{q1q2}{r^2}$
		- Direction of force along the line segment connecting charges
		- like charges, force is repellent
		- opposite charges, force is attractive
		- if there are more than 2 charges. use the principle of superposition:
			- determine the force as a vector for each charge pair, then add as vectors
