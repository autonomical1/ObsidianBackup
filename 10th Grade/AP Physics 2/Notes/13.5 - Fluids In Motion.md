- To avoid difficulties in modeling fluid dynamics, a simplified model of an ideal fluid is used:
	- 1. The fluid must be *incompressible*. 
	- 2. The flow of the fluid is *steady*.
		- **laminar flow**: when fluid velocity does not change at any part across the fluid
			- compared to turbulent flow

	- 3. The fluid is *nonviscous*
		- viscosity: resistance to flow

# The Equation of Continuity
- When squeezing a toothpaste tube, the volume of the paste that comes out matches the amount that you reduced the tube by.
	- An incompressible fluid flowing through a rigid tube acts the same way.
	- If a specific volume of fluid enters a tube during some time interval, the same amount of fluid must leave the tube.
	- ![[Pasted image 20220819150542.png]]
		- The same amount of fluid must travel through both sides of the tube.
- **equation of continuity**: V<sub>1</sub>A<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>
- ***The volume of an incompressible fluid entering one part of a tube or pipe must be matched by an equal volume leaving downstream.***
- ***Flow is faster in narrower parts of the tube, and slower in wider parts***
- Rate at which fluid flows through tube: **volume flow rate (Q)**
	- Q = 
	- Q = ΔV/Δt = vA
	- Units: m<sup>3</sup>/s or cm<sup>3</sup>/s
	- constant at all points of tube
# Representing Fluid Flow: Streamlines and Fluid Elements
- fluid flow is collective motion of a vast number of particles, which makes it difficult to model compared to a single particle
