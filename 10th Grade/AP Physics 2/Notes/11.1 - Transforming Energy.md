# Transforming Energy
- Energy can't be created or destroyed, but it can be transformed
- The energy in these transformations is not lost; it is converted to other forms that are less useful

- This is seen by ΔE = W<sub>ext</sub>
- Work is positive when energy is transferred into the system, and negative when energy is transferred out of the system
- When other forms of energy are transformed into thermal energy, the change is irreversible. **The energy isn't lost, it's just unusable**
	- ΔE = ΔK + ΔU + ΔE<sub>th</sub> + ΔE<sub>chem</sub> + ... = W
