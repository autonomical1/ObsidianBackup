# Transforming Energy
- Energy can't be created or destroyed, but it can be transformed
- The energy in these transformations is not lost; it is converted to other forms that are less useful

- This is seen by ΔE = W<sub>ext</sub>
- Work is positive when energy is transferred into the system, and negative when energy is transferred out of the system
- When other forms of energy are transformed into thermal energy, the change is irreversible. **The energy isn't lost, it's just unusable**
	- ΔE = ΔK + ΔU + ΔE<sub>th</sub> + ΔE<sub>chem</sub> + ... = W

# Efficiency
- The larger the energy losses in a system, the lower its efficiency
	- e = what you get/what you had to pay
- Reductions in efficiency are caused by **process limitations and fundamental limitations**
	- **process limitation**: energy loss due to a practical limitation of an energy transformation process
	- **fundamental limitation**: due to physical limitations
		- Power plants get 35% max efficiency due to this
