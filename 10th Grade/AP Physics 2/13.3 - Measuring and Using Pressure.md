# Manometers and Barometers
- Gas pressure is measured by a manometer
	- u-shaped tube that is connected to the gas at one end and is open to the air at the other end
		- tube normally filled with a liquid like mercury of a set density ρ
		- liquid is in static equilibrium, and a scale allows the user to measure the height h of the right side of the liquid above the left side

- atmospheric pressure is measured by a barometer
	- when the liquid on the inside and outside of the glass tube is in hydrostatic equilibrium,       P<sub>atmos</sub> = ρgh
	- if water was used, it would be difficult to show the actual pressure since the column would need to go much higher since it is
