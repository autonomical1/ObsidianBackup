# Manometers and Barometers
- Gas pressure is measured by a manometer
	- u-shaped tube that is connected to the gas at one end and is open to the air at the other end
		- tube normally filled with a liquid like mercury of a set density ρ
		- liquid is in static equilibrium, and a scale allows the user to measure the height h of the right side of the liquid above the left side

- atmospheric pressure is measured by a barometer
	- when the liquid on the inside and outside of the glass tube is in hydrostatic equilibrium,       P<sub>atmos</sub> = ρgh
	- if water was used, it would be difficult to show the actual pressure since the column would need to go much higher since water is not very dense. However, mercury has a density of 13,600 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which allows it to only be raised a small amount

# Blood Pressure
- When your heart beats, squeezing the blood throughout the body, the pressure increase that is created by that action is translated throughout the entire body, due to Pascal's Principle
- BP is measured in mm/Hg
	- it's a gauge pressure (more than 1 atm)
