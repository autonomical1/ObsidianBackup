### Magnetic Fields exert forces on moving charges
- Magnetic fields also exert forces on moving charged particles and on electric currents in wires
- If charge is stationary or moves parallel to a magnetic field, there is no magnetic force
- As the angle $\alpha$ between the velocity and the magnetic field increases, the magnetic force also increases. The force is greatest when the angle is 90$\degree$ The magnetic force is always perpendicular to the plane containing $\overrightarrow{v}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$

### Paths of Charged Particles in Magnetic Fields
- A particle moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field undergoes uniform circular motion at constant speed.
- $$F = \frac{mv^{2}}{r}$$--------------------------------------------------------------------$$F = |q|vB = \frac{mv^{2}}{r}$$--------------------------------------------------------------------$$r = \frac{mv}{|q|B}$$
