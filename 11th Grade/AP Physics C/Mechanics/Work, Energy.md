# Hooke's Lawâ—˜
- Springs have an equilibrium position, $X_{eq}$
-  when displaced, they produce a restoring force, $F_g =-kx$ , where K is the spring constant
- known as Hooke's Law

-  Where does $\Delta$E come from?
	- Stored energy from conversative spring force - potential energy 
	- Symbol: $U$
	- *Any* conservative force (gravity, spring, E-M) can store potential energy
	- Relationship $\Delta U_{c} = W_{ext} = -W_{c}$

# Power
- Definition $$P = \frac{dE}{dt}= \frac{dW}{dt}$$
- SI Unit: Watt [W] 
	- $1W = \frac{1J}{s}$
	- British Unit: Horsepower(hp)$$1hp = 550 \frac{ft\cdot lb}{s} = 746W$$

# Potential Energy and Force
- Recall that for _any_ conservative force: $W_{ext} = \Delta U_{c} = -W_{c} = -\int F_{c}\cdot dl$
- Then, $\Delta U_{c}= -\int F_{c} \cdot dl$

# Energy Diagrams
- Potential energy is a function of position
- Energy vs. Position graph
- GPE is a straight line with slope $mg$, and a $0$ y-intercept
- Energy diagram of a mass on a horizontal spring:

- PE is the parabola: $$U_{sp} = \frac{1}{2} k(x-L_{0})^{2}$$
- curve determined by spring constant
- Points of equilibrium: 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230922110042.png]]
	- static equilibrium: particle at rest at $x_{2}$, can't move away from $x_{2}$
	- equilibrium for which small disturbances cause the particle to stay in the same place is stable equilibrium, if they move away, it is unstable equilirbium.

## Finding force from Potential Energy
- $F_{s} = \frac{-dU}{dX}$
	- negative of the slope of the PE curve at X
