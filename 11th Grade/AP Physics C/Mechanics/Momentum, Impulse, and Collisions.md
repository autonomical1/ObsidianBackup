# Collisions, Impulse, and Momentum
- Collision: Two or more objects exchange forces at close range.
	- ex:

- Forces exchanged in a collision are known as **impulsive forces** since each object delivers an *impulse* to the other one.
- Newton's Second Law: $$\sum\limits \overrightarrow{F} = m \frac{d\overrightarrow{v}}{dt}$$so: $$\sum\limits \overrightarrow{F} = \frac{d(m\overrightarrow{v})}{dt}$$ where $p = mv$,
   therefore: $$F_{imp}= \sum\limits \overrightarrow{F} = \frac{dp}{dt}$$
   rewritten: $$dp = F_{imp} (t) dt$$
   for an entire collision from $t_{i}$ to $t_{f}$: $$\Delta p = \int_{p_{i}}^{p_{f}} F_{imp}(t) dt$$
# Impulse-Momentum Theorem
$$\Delta p = \int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}} F(t) dt$$
- Note: If $F(t)$ is uniform $F_{avg}$, then $\Delta p = F_{avg}\Delta t \rightarrow F_{avg} \cdot \Delta t = m\cdot \Delta v$

- General: $F_{imp}$ associated with work and impulse: $$\Delta K = W_{ext} = \int_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}} F(x) dx$$ $$\Delta p _{x} = J_{x} = \int_{t_{i}}^{t_{f}} F(t)dt$$

# Two Objects Colliding

- If no external forces (impulse approximation), then $J_{12} = J_{21}$ and $\Delta p_{2} = \Delta p_{1}$, so $$\Delta p_{1} + \Delta p_{2} = 0$$ (conservation of momentum)

#### Momentum Conservation depends on the choice of the system
- Ex: Ball in Freefall
	- System: Ball + Earth
		- ![[Pasted image 20230929112959.png|100]]
	- System: Ball only

# Inelastic Collisions
- A collision in which the two objects stick together and move with a common final velocity: **perfectly inelastic collision**
	- Ex: 
		- Piece of clay hits the floor
		- bullet strikes a block of wood and embeds itself in the block
		- Railroad cars coupling together upon impact
		- dart hitting a dart board

# Elastic Collision
- Collision where mechanical energy is conserved - perfectly elastic collision
- momentum conserved in all collisions

# Explosions
- Explosions are opposite of collisions
- Brief, intense interaction, then they move apart from each other
- The explosive forces are *internal*
- If system isolated, total momentum during explosion is conserved
