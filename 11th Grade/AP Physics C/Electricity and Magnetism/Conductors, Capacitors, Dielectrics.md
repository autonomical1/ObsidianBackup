# Capacitors:
- Any configuration of two conductors having equal charge with opposite sign is known as a **capacitor**.

- Often (almost always), the conductors are parallel plates.
	- Known as a **parallel plate capacitor**
	- ![[Pasted image 20240209110257.png]]
		- *Strong* and uniform $\vec{E}$ between the plates.
	- Types:
		- Ceramic disk capacitor
		- Electrolytic capacitor
- Empirical Result: $$Q \propto \Delta V$$
	- Constant of proportionality is known as the *capacitance* of the capacitor.$$Q= C\Delta V$$
		- $C$ (capacitance) - measure of the ability to store charge.
		- SI Unit: Farad ($F$), where $1F = \frac{1C}{1V}$
		- Most capacitors are in the $pF, nF, \mu F, mF$
## Parallel Plate Capacitor
$$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V}$$Also, $E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_{0}}$ where $\sigma = \frac{Q}{A}$ $$E = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_{0}A}$$$$Q = \epsilon_{0} EA$$Also, $\Delta V = E \cdot d$ where $\vec{E}$ is uniform
Substituting: $$C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V} = \frac{\epsilon_{0} EA}{E\cdot d}$$$$C = \epsilon_{0} \frac{A}{d}$$
- $\epsilon_{0} = 8.854 * 10^{-12} \frac{C^{2}}{Nm^{2}}$
- $A$ = plate area
- $d$ = plate separation
