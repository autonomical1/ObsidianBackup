- Electric effects were first noticed by the ancient Greeks.
- Discovered that amber could pick up small pieces of cloth or straw.
- Benjamin Franklin (18th C)
	- Discovered two types of charge:
	- Named them "positive" and "negative"
- Most matter is electrically **neutral**
	- **Neutral**: equal numbers of + (protons) and - (electrons)
		- *no net charge*
- Charged Objects: **Always have +/- imbalance** **Always transfer electrons** 
- Properties of charge:
	- **conserved**
	- **quantized**
	-  Any charge, q, has specific values so that $q = Ne$ where $N$ is an integer and $e$ is the magnitude of electron charge.
