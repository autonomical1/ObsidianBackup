- Electric effects were first noticed by the ancient Greeks.
- Discovered that amber could pick up small pieces of cloth or straw.
- Benjamin Franklin (18th C)
	- Discovered two types of charge:
	- Named them "positive" and "negative"
- Most matter is electrically **neutral**
	- **Neutral**: equal numbers of + (protons) and - (electrons)
		- *no net charge*
- Charged Objects: **Always have +/- imbalance** **Always transfer electrons** 
- Properties of charge:
	- **conserved**
	- **quantized**
	-  Any charge, q, has specific values so that $q = Ne$ where $N$ is an integer and $e$ is the magnitude of electron charge.
- **Charged Particles**:
	- *Proton*: $q_{p} = +e$
	- *Electron:* $q_{e} = -e$
	- $e$: Fundamental unit of charge

## Charging by Friction
- Two objects can be charged by rubbing them together.
	- Ex: Rubber & Fur
	- Ex: Glass & Silk

## Charging by conduction:
- Consider a charged rubber rod and a neutral conducting sphere.

## Electrostatic Force:
- Recall that electric charges exert forces on one another (Newton's 3rd Law).
- Like charges repel ($+/+$ or $-/-$)
- Opposite charges attract ($+/-$ or $-/+$)

## Conductors and Insulators
- **Conductors**: Allow charges to move freely throughout the material; tend to be metallic
- **Insulators**: Do not allow charge to move freely; tend to be nonmetallic

## Polarization of an Insulator

## Polarization of a conductor: 
- Assume conductor is initially neutral
	- no net charge

## Charge by induction:
- Connect one side of conductor to an electrical ground
- Ground:
