### Magnetic Field of a Straight, Current Carrying Wire
- **Right-Hand Rule of Fields**

### Calculating the Magnetic Field due to a Current
- Magnetic field strengths are measured in **Tesla**, T
- The magnitude of the magnetic field around a long, straight current-carrying wire depends on the distance r from the wire and the *current* I through the wire:
	- $$B = \frac{\mu_{0}I}{2\pi r}$$(Magnetic field due to a long, straight current-carrying wire)
	- $\mu_0$ is the **permeability constant**. It relates the strength of the magnetic field to the currents that produce it.
		- $\mu_{0} = 1.26 * 10^{-6}$ $T \cdot m/A$ $= 4\pi * 10^{-7}$ $T\cdot \frac{m}{A}$
