I am okay. At least I think. I feel as if I can only worry about my grades. That's the only thing that I can do. I also hated the fact that grades had to come out over thanksgiving break, because all I could hear is my parents grilling me on studying. I know that it is out of good intentions because my parents really care about me and want me to get into a nice college.
