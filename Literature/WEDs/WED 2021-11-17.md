The meanest person I know is our current PE Coach. She gets mad at me for not being able to breath while we are doing exercises. Both of the coaches believe that I just slack off when I just can't do the exercise to its full extent. Just yesterday, we were doing exercises and I was having a problem exercising, and the coach says "I think Neel's over there slacking."
