Tags: [[Literature Notes]] [[A Christmas Carol]] [[Stave 3]] [[Literature]]


It was the living room. There was no doubt about that. It looked newer. It looked better. The stains weren't there. The couch wasn't wrinkled. All I saw was the smallest Christmas tree ever. It was silver and shiny, but it looked tired. It looked as if it had been used for at least 3 or 4 years but had never been appreciated. Its only purpose was to provide happiness to anyone who wanted it. I saw a table filled with the most amount of food I've ever seen in my life. There was turkey, chicken, cornbread, bread rolls, pastries, soups, salads, apples, oranges, candied pecans, wine, water, 

I swear I thought I saw someone swiftly fly past the tree. The tree, silver in all its tiny might, stood stiff. The star, replaced by a red ball resembling Rudolph's nose, had looked like there was no color, as if it was the only part of the tree in the 1930's. As soon as I looked away from the nose, I heard a long and loud "SWOOSH" past me. I looked back and I saw a small girl, not older than 8, as if she was stuck in a black-and-white movie from the 1950's. She looked sad. She seemed as if someone had stole her happiness. The last thing I remember seeing was the tiny, silver, sad, and tired Christmas tree fall to the ground.
